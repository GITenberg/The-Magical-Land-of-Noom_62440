Gran’pa had finished building the
chicken coop and he walked out in
front of the house to speak to a
neighbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny and Janey, who had
been watching Gran’pa with such
interest, grew tired of waiting for
his return.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s build a Flying Machine,”
Johnny said after a while.
“Grand’pa has finished and will not need the boards that are
left and we can find plenty of nails.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Do you think we can build a Flying Machine?” asked
Janey, delighted at the idea.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Easily!” Johnny told her. “Of course we can’t make
one that will really fly, but we can pretend that it goes ’way
up in the air.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be loads of fun!” cried Janey, and she jumped
up and down and smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Johnny got an old box and nailed four or five boards
to the sides for wings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It should have a sail,” Janey said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it needs a sail and a mast and a rudder,” replied
Johnny. “Run in and ask Gran’ma for an old sheet to make
the sail of, will you, Janey? I’ll be putting on a mast and
the rudder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Janey came running back with an old sheet she
cried, “I just thought! We must have something to start and
stop the Flying Machine with, so Gran’ma gave me two empty
spools. We can use them.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Just the thing!” Johnny answered. “I’ll put them at
the front of the box and label one ‘Start’ and the other
‘Stop.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can we guide the Flying Machine when we get to
flying?” Janey asked. “When we make believe we’re flying,
I mean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve put only one nail in the rudder,” Johnny replied,
“so that by pulling on these strings we can guide it. See?”
And Johnny showed his sister how the board with only one
nail in it turned from side to side as he pulled the strings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! That’s fine!” Janey exclaimed. “I’ll ask Gran’ma
if we may have some lunch to take with us on our trip,” she
added, as she ran into the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Janey came out with a tiny basket of lunch Johnny
had marked “Polly Ann” on both sides of the box. He
had fastened the sail made from the old sheet to a stick and
run a string through a screw-eye, so that the sail could be
raised or lowered whenever they might wish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s see!” Johnny mused. “Have we everything we
need?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, here are the wings, the rudder, the ‘Start’ and
‘Stop’ spools and the sail,” Janey told him. “I think that
is all, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, then, Sis! Put the lunch on one of the
sails. No!” and Johnny hammered a nail on one side of
the box, “hang the basket of lunch there and climb in. It’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>going to be a tight squeeze for both of us. But it won’t take
this Flying Machine long to get to Mars or Venus or the Moon,
and we can get out and rest on some of the Stars if we get
tired.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s go to the Moon first, and then to the Milky Way!”
Janey cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, if you are ready!” Johnny agreed, as he sat in
the bottom of the box, in front of Janey. “Hold your hat, Sis,
for here she goes!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Johnny turned one of the spools in the front of the
box.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! isn’t the view grand from up here, Johnny!” Janey
cried. “See, there is Gran’ma’s house ’way down below, and
we are getting closer to the Moon all the time!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those are queer birds flying by, Sis,” said Johnny, who
could make believe any way he liked. “Can you make out
what they are?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” Janey answered, as she looked at the chickens in
the yard, “they are Eagles. See that beautiful big one with
the red comb? That’s a Roc!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“My, I wish this Flying Machine would really Fly!”
Johnny said, a little later. “But it’s fun pretending anyway.
Let’s get out at the next Star, Sis, and eat our lunch.
I didn’t eat much breakfast and I’m hungry!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, Brud!” said Janey, who wasn’t tired of the
play either. “Wait a minute!” as Johnny started to climb
out of the box. “You forgot to stop the Flying Machine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I’ll bring it to a stop very slowly,” Johnny told
her. “So that we won’t strike these mountain tops and tip
over!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And he turned the “Stop” spool a fraction of an inch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Neither of the children was prepared for what followed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Polly Ann shot up over the fence, suddenly, scattering
the startled chickens in all directions, and as Johnny and
Janey crouched low in the box the familiar objects about the
farm whizzed by them like bullets.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are really going!” Janey gasped, as they sped upward.
“I feel as if I’d like to jump!”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this Johnny caught his sister’s foot and held it tight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t look over the side until you get used to flying!”
he cautioned her, very wisely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Twist the other spool!” Janey told him. “I don’t like
to be up so high. Everything seems so small.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny gave the other spool a twist and the Flying Machine
swept ahead at twice its former speed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re twisting the wrong spool!” Janey screamed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“You must have been twisting the wrong one all the time,
somehow. See, you’ve been twisting the one marked ‘Start.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure enough! That’s just what I did,” Johnny admitted.
“Well, I’ll twist the other now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Flying Machine came to such a sudden halt that the
children were almost thrown from the box, and the basket of
lunch was whirled off its nail so suddenly that it flew straight
ahead of the Flying Machine for nearly a hundred feet before
it curved to the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The children watched it curve and circle as it fell. Then
the paper came off and there was a regular shower of sandwiches,
doughnuts and small cakes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Mister! You be careful or we’ll never get back!”
Janey cried as she clutched her brother tightly by the collar.
“Send the Flying Machine down to the ground again, Johnny.
Please do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Flying Machine, when it stopped, hung suspended
in the air although when Johnny gently twisted the “Start”
spool and it started off again, it went in the opposite direction
from the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It won’t go down,” cried Johnny, as he brought the Flying
Machine to a stop again. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, if it won’t go down, there’s nothing to do but go
on!” Janey answered. “It’s all your fault for building the
Flying Machine!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Sis, that isn’t fair!” cried Johnny. “You know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>you suggested putting on the spools, and if we’d left them off
we shouldn’t have started. What we should have thought of
was something to make the Flying Machine go up or down as
we wanted. Now it only goes ahead or stops.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Try guiding it with the rudder,” Janey suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Johnny twisted the “Start” spool, and as the Flying
Machine started forward he pulled one of the rudder strings.
The Flying Machine slowly turned and flew in a large circle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can’t do it!” Janey cried, the tears coming to her eyes.
“We can’t make it go down as we want to! We’re only flying
in a circle above Gran’ma’s farm. See! Gran’ma and Gran’pa
and a lot of other people are out looking at us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sure enough, so far below that they looked like tiny specks
of dust, the children could see their grandparents and many
of the neighbors watching them as they sailed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny brought the Flying Machine to a stop directly over
Gran’ma and Gran’pa and the neighbors, and they could hear
Gran’pa calling to them quite distinctly. The children called
back at the top of their voices, but they couldn’t make Gran’ma
and Gran’pa hear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny tried twisting first one spool and then the other,
but this jerked the Flying Machine so violently that his sister
objected. She said she would rather go on than stay just where
they were, doing nothing. So the children took off their hats
and waved farewell to the people below, and Johnny, twisting
the “Start” spool gently at first, increased the speed until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the Flying Machine sped along like a meteor, leaving the farm
far below and behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>The different colors in the fields gave the Earth a sort of
patchwork effect, but as the Flying Machine climbed higher
and higher the yellows and greens and blues blended together
until the Earth was more the color of an opal. In fact, the
children now saw a continuous change of colors, ranging from
a deep yellow to a bluish purple, with every now and then a
speck of crimson as the sunlight glanced along a hill.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t it beautiful!” Janey cried. “I don’t feel as if I
wished to jump any more, do you, Brud?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t feel like jumping,” her brother answered,
and he stopped the Flying Machine so that he could see better.
“Look, Sis, what causes that yellow blaze down there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>They both looked over the side of the Flying Machine and
saw the Earth bathed in a sheen of gold, with here and there
glimpses of brilliant purple showing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I know what it is now!” Janey cried, presently. “A
thunder storm has just passed between us and the Earth and
the sun is shining on the Clouds. Look! See the lightning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A faint rumble came up to them as of someone rolling
potatoes down a wooden trough, and a vivid streak of blue
zigzagged through the yellow of the clouds.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The purple we see is the Earth in shadow beneath the
clouds,” Johnny concluded, after a while.</p>

<p class='c010'>The children watched the strange sight for a long time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>before they decided to go on. Then they looked away for a
moment, and when they looked back toward the Earth they
could not find it at once. They had traveled so far that the
Earth now seemed no larger than a bright Star, and but for
the fact that it was almost beneath them they would never
have recognized it at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lots of other Stars could be plainly seen now. The
Moon had grown to an enormous size; in fact, it almost filled
the sky behind them. The children were greatly surprised to
see it. They had been watching the Stars in front of them
and they had not once turned their heads the other way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?” Janey cried suddenly, as she grasped her
brother’s arm and pulled one of the rudder strings so that the
Flying Machine swung around to face the Moon.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Johnny was so startled at the wonderful sight that he gave
the “Stop” spool a twist and brought the Flying Machine to
a stop with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be the Moon!” said Johnny, in an awed voice,
after he had looked at the enormous object in speechless
amazement for fully five minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It <i>is</i> the Moon, Brud!” Janey agreed. “See, there is the
Man in the Moon’s face as plain as day, and there are mountains
and valleys, too. See?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Moon, seen from where the children viewed it, was of
a pale bluish-greenish tint, except where the rays of the Sun
slanted across the mountain peaks and into the deep valleys.
It seemed to Johnny and Janey as though they were looking
through beautiful blue-green glass down into a dark well; for
wherever the Sun did not shine or was not reflected from the
mountains into the valleys the Moon’s surface was black—so
black that it made the rest of the Moon seem transparent.
This seemed to the children very strange.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, Sis,” Johnny exclaimed, “this can’t be the Moon
after all! It must be some extra big Star.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“I believe it is the Moon,” said his sister, “for, you can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>see the face of the Man in the Moon quite plainly. But it is
a great deal larger than it usually is, and it doesn’t look quite
as it does from the earth. But see! There are the Man’s eyes
and nose and mouth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I see now,” Johnny admitted. “But it isn’t exactly
the same view we have from the Earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right, Johnny!” said Janey, after a moment. “It
isn’t the same view. We must have passed to the other side
of the Moon!”</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Johnny started the Flying
Machine again and steered it
toward the Moon. And as they
whirled around the side of the
Moon the part that resembled
a man’s face twisted about until
it disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t tell whether we are
getting closer to the Moon or not!” cried Johnny anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently, however, they saw the face of the Man in the
Moon coming around from the other side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must have made a complete circuit of the Moon,”
Janey decided. “See, Johnny, the rudder is pulled over to
one side! That’s the reason!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny pulled the rudder string until the Flying Machine
was aimed right at the Moon, and they approached it at great
speed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Slow up, Johnny!” Janey cried, when they could make
out all the mountain tops and valleys very distinctly. “It
feels too much as if we were falling when we go so fast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Johnny twisted the “Start” spool backwards until they
were flying very slowly and seemed to be floating down toward
the Moon’s surface as lightly as a feather.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Flying Machine still was headed directly toward the
Moon, and this gave the children the impression that they
were falling. But Johnny, by pulling the rudder about occasionally,
steered the Flying Machine so that they landed
among large mushrooms and queer ferns, instead of on the
mountain tops or in the deep valleys they had seen on the
other side of the Moon.</p>

<p class='c010'>For, although the children did not know this, they had
passed around the side of the Moon that always faces the
Earth and had alighted in the Magical Land of Noom.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Johnny and Janey Meet the Strange Man</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>By twisting the “Start” spool backward and forward
Johnny had brought the Flying Machine to the
Moon’s surface very gently, but by no twisting of
rudder or the spools could he effect a landing except by heading
the Flying Machine directly for the surface. It was in
this manner that the machine came to rest, with the front of
the box resting upon the surface of the Moon, and the rudder
sticking up in the air. The children sat in the box as though
they were tied there and were very much surprised to find that
they did not fall to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>There they sat—directly facing the ground, with their
backs to the sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s get out and look around, Janey! This feels too
funny, sitting this way!” And Johnny started to put his foot
over the side of the box down to the Moon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait a moment!” Janey cried as she caught her brother
and held him. “We may tumble back into the sky if we get
out of the Flying Machine!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not think we shall do that! I had not thought of it,
though!” Johnny mused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One thing certain—it is a long fall to the farm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally Janey cried, “I have it!” And she took off her
slipper and held it out to the side of the box. Johnny watched
her with much interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the slipper falls to the ground, it is safe for us to get
out!” she said as she dropped it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The slipper dropped very slowly to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It didn’t seem to want to go very much!” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Try the other one,” Johnny suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second slipper floated to the ground in the same
manner, very slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>This puzzled the children, and they were undecided just
what to do until another idea struck Janey. “I’ll hold your
hand while you climb out, so that if you start to fall up in
the air, I can pull you back into the box!” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>So while his sister held his hand Johnny stepped from the
box to the surface of the Moon and straightened up. “Dear
me!” he exclaimed. “You look funny sitting there, Janey.
Climb out!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How does it feel when you stand up, Johnny?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Natural!” he replied. “Come on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like to!” Janey said, holding to the sides of the
box. “It seems so queer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this Johnny pushed on the rudder of the Flying Machine
and tipped the box over backward, so that his sister found
herself sitting up in the box, while the box rested in a natural
position upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” Janey exclaimed, as she stood up beside Johnny.
“What a relief! My legs are stiff and cramped.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When she stepped from the box Janey intended hopping
up and down to straighten out the cramps, but when she
jumped she rose in the air six or eight feet, and Johnny, springing
to catch his sister, who seemed about to fly off the Moon,
gave such a spring he rose ten feet in the air and passed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both children settled slowly to the ground, and when they
reached there they sat down and held to mushrooms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny wiped the perspiration from his forehead. “My
goodness! I thought we were both goners then,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently they both laughed. “How silly we are! If we
had only thought we wouldn’t have been scared a bit!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Johnny exclaimed. “The Moon is so much lighter than the
earth the attraction of gravity is not so strong, and we naturally
are lighter. Look at this, Sis!” he continued jumping
up in the air and throwing his feet out in front of him, so
that he took what in the water is called “A Seat in Congress.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be careful, Bud!” Janey exclaimed anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are safe,” said Johnny as he settled slowly to the
ground, “and we can have barrels of fun doing stunts!
Whee!” and he stamped both feet upon the ground and gave
such a spring that he turned over and over in the air four or
five times before he settled to the ground again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey could not see so much fun without being in it herself,
so she caught Johnny’s hand and they turned flip-flops
and jumped up into the air and pretended they were swimming
as they came down. They were having the best time of
their lives.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then, seeing some giant mushrooms not far off, Johnny
called to Janey and ran toward them. When about twenty
feet away he leaped and sailed through the air
up to the top of the tallest, one about ten
feet high. Janey followed, and they
jumped from one mushroom to
another. Sometimes they
missed the jump, but this
did not matter, as they
settled to the ground easily and gently.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Janey and Johnny played among the giant mushrooms for
a long time, doing all sorts of tricks, and jumping around until
they grew tired.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they sat under an immense fern, resting, Johnny said,
“It’s too bad we lost the lunch, Sis. I’m beginning to feel
hungry!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like some of Granny’s doughnuts!” Janey said.
“Let’s see if we can find any berries or fruit to eat. I’ve read
that is the way all shipwrecked people do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps we shall have to live on
mussels and clams,” said Johnny as
he arose. “Let’s find something! I
could almost eat one of these
mushrooms!” And Johnny
broke off a piece of mushroom
and held it towards Janey.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Janey caught a whiff of the mushroom and said, “It smells
good enough to eat!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny smelt the piece he had in his hands and then took a
tiny bite.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be careful, Johnny!” Janey warned. “You know Granny
said there was really no way to tell whether a mushroom was a
mushroom or a toad-stool, except by eating it, and if you ate it
and it was poison it was a toad-stool, and if you ate it and it
did not hurt you, it was a mushroom!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ummmmm!” Johnny exclaimed, when he had tasted the
mushroom. “It’s fine, Janey!” and Johnny broke off another
piece and ate it as if it had been cake.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll wait and see if it poisons you first!” said Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny picked off pieces of different mushrooms and tried
them. “They’re different, Janey!” he cried. “You’re missing
it! Try this piece! It tastes of raspberry or blackberry, I can’t
tell which!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey nibbled at the piece Johnny gave her and found the
flavor excellent. She went to the mushroom from which
Johnny had broken the piece and tore off a chunk as large
as her head and began to eat it. The mushrooms were
sweet and of different flavors, tasting just like cake. The
children discovered that the old mushrooms which had turned
brown were of chocolate or ginger flavor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can’t starve with all these goodies!” cried Johnny.
“I feel as if I had just finished a Thanksgiving dinner!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Janey left Johnny sitting under one of the mushrooms and
walked about to see if she could discover a spring, as the sweet
mushrooms had made her very thirsty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny had eaten so much it made him drowsy, and before
Janey had gone far he was sound asleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey passed under the mushrooms and giant ferns until
she came to an open space in the center of which a spring
bubbled up.</p>

<p class='c010'>Walking up to the spring, Janey was surprised to see no
outlet for the water. It bubbled up just as water would bubble
in a kettle when boiling, but this water felt very cold when
she put her finger in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon tasting the water Janey found it sour. “Lemonade!”
she cried, and running to the side of the clearing she
picked a large leaf and folded it for a cup.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lemonade was just sweet enough, and Janey drank
two large leavesful. She was dipping in again when she
heard a tread upon the grass behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Johnny,” she cried, “I’ve found a spring of lemonade
and it is lovely!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, as Johnny did not answer, she turned her head and
saw a strange Man approaching her with upraised stick and
a fierce frown upon his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who said you might drink of my spring!” he shouted,
quickening his walk to a hop and waving his arms in a threatening
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“I—I—I—did not know it was your spring!” the little
girl answered, as she scrambled to her feet and dropped her
leaf-cup.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course you didn’t!” the Strange Man cried as he came
up to her and caught her arm fiercely. “Of course you didn’t!
Of course you didn’t!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And with that he raised his stick above his head as if to
strike her. “I’ll teach you to drink of my spring!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey screamed and pulled with all her might to get away,
but the Strange Man held her tightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny, hearing his sister’s cry, came running through the
ferns, and seeing the Strange Man about to hit Janey, he flew
at him like a little tiger. When about eight feet from the
Strange Man, Johnny, who was running at good speed, jumped
through the air and landed upon the Strange Man’s back. The
force of his dive carried himself and the Strange Man head
over heels, knocked off the Strange Man’s tall hat and made
him lose his hold upon Janey and the stick.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny was on top when they finally quit rolling and with
all his might he pummeled the Strange Man about the head.
The Strange Man’s long legs kicked through the air and he
scratched at Johnny’s face with his long fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Strange Man cried out for Johnny to quit, but Johnny,
angry at the Strange Man’s treatment of his sister, managed
to get his knees on the Strange Man’s arms, sat upon his chest
and pounded him right and left.</p>

<p>“You just wait! I’ll catch you and pay you back!” (page <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Say enough!” Johnny yelled. “Say enough! Say
enough!” and Johnny caught hold of the Strange Man’s long
hair and bumped his head upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey held her breath. It was the first time she had ever
seen Johnny in a fight, for he was a quiet little fellow and
always avoided a fight if it were possible. But now Johnny
was very angry, and Janey felt sorry for the Strange Man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let him up, Johnny! He’s had enough! He says for
you to quit! Let him up!” Janey cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, you keep back, Sis!” Johnny shouted, his eyes full
of tears. “I’ll teach him to strike you! There!—There! Will
you ever—There!—do it again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I won’t! Honest!” the Strange Man cried, closing
his eyes tight each time Johnny bumped his head on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right!” Johnny said as he got off of the Strange Man
and stood back to see what he would do upon getting up from
the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Strange Man picked up his hat and stick without
looking at Johnny, turned and walked across the clearing.
When he had reached the other side he looked over his shoulder,
and shaking his stick at the children he cried, “You just
wait! I’ll catch you and pay you back! You just wait!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny, in spite of his sister’s attempt to hold him back,
ran across the clearing after the Strange Man, who turned
again and sped through the ferns like a deer.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>When Johnny reached the edge of the clearing he stamped
his feet upon the ground loudly. The Strange Man, thinking
Johnny was close behind him, redoubled his efforts and catching
his foot in a vine went sprawling among the ferns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny doubled up with laughter and Janey could not
help joining in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My! You surely can fight, Johnny!” she said admiringly.
Janey put her arm around her brother’s neck and kissed
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah shucks!” said Johnny, embarrassed. “I couldn’t stand
to see him strike you, Janey, but I don’t like to fight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Weren’t you mad though! You cried!” Janey went on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s it!” Johnny exclaimed. “I get too angry and
have to cry like a boo baby! That’s why I always get licked,
because my eyes fill up with tears and I can’t see!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh Johnny, I’ll bet you don’t always get licked, either!
You can lick anyone I’ll bet, if you want to!” his sister said
proudly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well of course I really don’t get licked every time!”
Johnny admitted. Then, with a laugh, he added, “Because
sometimes I can run faster than the other fellow and he doesn’t
catch me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course it’s wrong to fight!” Janey said as they walked
away in a different direction from the one taken by the
Strange Man. “It always seems so useless, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Unless it’s something like this fight!” Johnny answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess I couldn’t have fought so well if I hadn’t been
fighting for you! Did he hurt you much, Janey?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He hurt me when he pinched my arm, but he didn’t hit
me with the stick,” Janey said, as she showed Johnny the
bruised place on her arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a good thing I didn’t know of that bruise,” cried
Johnny, “while I had him down!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As they talked the children came to a path. They walked
down it until they saw a queer little house made of sticks plastered
together with mud and colored clay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a queer house!” the children cried. “Isn’t it
small!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked up to the door and knocked. “Come in!”
a voice called to them from within.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the children, pushing open the door, stepped inside.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first they could see nothing, for the door had swung shut
behind them, but presently their
eyes growing accustomed to the
darkness, they made out a form
across the room.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“My! It’s dark!” Janey exclaimed. “Can’t we have a
light!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The form across the room chuckled and Johnny reached
behind him for the door-knob, so that he could let some light
into the room. The door was locked!</p>

<p class='c010'>When Johnny found this out he stepped in front of Janey.
“Keep behind me, Sis!” he whispered. “This doesn’t seem
safe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment something struck Johnny in the face and
splashed all over. It took him so by surprise he staggered backward
and stumbled over Janey, so that both the children fell
to the floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he scrambled to his feet Johnny felt his arms caught and
a rope whirled around and around his arms and legs, so that
he could not move.</p>

<p class='c010'>A bright flame shot up from the fireplace and the children
saw the Strange Man sitting there with a book across his knees.
He had just thrown a powder in the fireplace and it burnt
brightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Strange Man was the only one in the room except the
children and he mumbled to himself as he read from the great
book. Johnny looked at Janey and saw that she was tied in
much the same manner as himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the man who owns the Lemonade Spring,” cried Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say!” Johnny shouted. “You untie us and let us go, or
we’ll have you arrested when we get out!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“You won’t get out!” the Strange Man told him. “I’ll
see to that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Help!” Johnny shouted at the top of his voice, Janey
joining him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me!” the Strange Man exclaimed fretfully. “How
can you expect me to change you into animals when you make
so much noise? You distract my mind from my reading, and
I am trying to find just how to work the magic!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that a magic book?” Janey asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course!” the Strange Man replied. “And I have to
memorize the magic song that I must sing when I puff the magic
powder over you and change you into animals, and I can not
think when you make so much noise!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’re sorry we drank your lemonade!” Janey said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m sorry I had a fight with you!” Johnny said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes! I know you are,” the Strange Man cried, shaking
his stick at them, “and I told you that I would get even with
you! I am about to change you into pigs!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh dear! I don’t care to be changed into a pig!” Janey
cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe he can do it!” Johnny told her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, don’t you!” the Strange Man hissed, as he put down
the large book and came towards Johnny. “I can easily change
you into a cat, but I am learning the rhyme to change you into
pigs and then I’ll show you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey began crying and Johnny said, “Don’t cry, Sis!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>He’s trying to fool you! He can’t change us into anything, it
isn’t possible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Strange Man puffed some powder from a tiny bellows
upon Johnny and began to sing.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A diddle daddle hunka dee, A chunka lunka diddle fee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Kerlike kerlunk kachunkapat, and so I change you to a cat!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“There! I guess you believe it possible now, don’t you?”
the Strange Man said when he stopped singing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Meow!” said Johnny. “Meow!” He <i>had</i> changed into
a cat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Killikaluka, willyculoosa! Now I change you to a boy!”
said the Strange Man, again puffing the powder upon Johnny,
and changing him back to a boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What shall we do?” Janey cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must keep still,” the Strange Man commanded, “or
I can never change you to pigs!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us keep yelling at the top of our lungs,” cried Johnny,
“so that he can not study the rhyme to change us into pigs!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So the two children began yelling at the top of their voices,
and the Strange Man grew so impatient he finally said, “Well,
if you continue like that, I shall have to go outside and study,
but it will be all the worse for you when I do change you to
pigs, for I shan’t let you see a mud puddle for two years!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And as the children continued their cries, the Strange Man
closed his book and went out by a back door. He stamped
along the walk kicking the loose pebbles viciously.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Gran’ma and Gran’pa Fly After the Children</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>When Gran’pa and Gran’ma saw the children fly
over the fence they could scarcely believe their eyes.
They shouted as loudly as possible for Janey and
Johnny to come back.</p>

<p class='c010'>And when the children circled above the farm in their
home-made Flying Machine, all the neighbors, hearing the
cries of the two old people, came running over to the farm and
watched the strange sight.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the home-made Flying Machine rapidly disappeared
in the sky the two old people put their arms around each other
and wept like children.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Of course there was nothing they could do, so they went
into the house and sat down upon the old couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They were such good children!” Gran’ma sobbed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They were always good children!” Gran’pa cried. “Oh
dear! Oh dear!”</p>

<p class='c010'>All the rest of the day the old people thought of Janey and
Johnny and wondered what had become of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish we could go in search of them!” Gran’pa said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where did they get such a wonderful Flying Machine?”
Gran’ma asked as she wiped the tears from Gran’pa’s eyes and
her own with her apron.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They made it from an old box and some boards I had left
after finishing my chicken coop!” Gran’pa told her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I remember now!” Gran’ma said. “Janey came in
and asked me for an old sheet for a sail, and for two spools.
The spools, she said, would be the ‘Start’ and ‘Stop’ twisters
for the flying machine!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s funny they didn’t come back when we called to them!”
Gran’pa mused. “They always have minded so well!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe they knew how to work the Flying Machine
so that they could return to the earth!” Gran’ma replied.
“Perhaps they did not think it would really fly and so neglected
to put something on to send the machine down. I am
sure that must have been the reason!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must have been!” Gran’pa mused. “But see here,
why can’t we go after them and bring them back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Gran’ma! If the children could build a Flying Machine, I
see no reason why I couldn’t build one! In fact,” Gran’pa
continued, “I could build a better one, I’m sure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how do we know where they have gone to?” Gran’ma
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can easily find out!” Gran’pa said, as he walked to
the door. “I will build my machine with many spools on it,
and one spool we will mark ‘Direction taken by the children’
and the machine will follow them everywhere they have gone
until we find them! The other spools can be labeled ‘Stop,’
‘Go,’ ‘Rise,’ ‘Lower,’ and anything else we can think of. We
must be careful and have everything complete before we start!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is six o’clock now,” Gran’pa added. “I should have it
finished by eight or nine o’clock and we can start the first thing
in the morning!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Gran’pa took all his tools out in the back yard and began
to work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny had picked out the largest box around the place
and all that Gran’pa could find were four little soap boxes;
these he nailed together.</p>

<p class='c010'>A neighbor boy came over to watch Gran’pa, and when he
heard what Gran’pa was building he said, “Gran’pa, why don’t
you borrow my boat? I should be glad to let you have it, and
you could put a sail on it and fix it up fine!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will be great, Eddie!” Gran’pa said, “I’ll come right
over and get it!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>So Gran’pa hitched up old Ned, and telling Gran’ma where
he was going, he drove over to Eddie’s home and brought back
the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>It did not take Gran’pa long to make the wings on either
side of the boat. He took all the spools he could find and
nailed them around the front part. He made a rudder behind
that could be turned in any direction. Gran’pa, when he had
the boat completed, sat and thought a minute, then he went
into the buggy shed and taking two lamps from an old surrey
he trimmed the wicks, filled them with oil and fastened them
on the sides of the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he had everything to his liking, it was still daylight
and he called Gran’ma to come out and see the new Flying
Boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think it will really go?” Gran’ma asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jump in and let’s try it!” Gran’pa cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the two old people climbed into the boat and Gran’pa
twisted one of the spools. The Flying Boat rose quietly in
the air and flew about as Gran’pa twisted the spools or the
rudder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a success!” both cried as Gran’pa brought the boat
back to the starting point.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they settled to the ground, Gran’ma ran into the
house and came out with Gran’pa’s coat and hat. She had put
on her best bonnet and shawl. She had Janey’s and Johnny’s
coats and several sweaters with her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Gran’ma had prepared a large basket of food while Gran’pa
had been working on the boat, so she told Gran’pa to get this
while she filled a jar with water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we find them, the dears will be hungry and thirsty,”
Gran’ma said, “and it is such a beautiful evening we might as
well start now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right!” Gran’pa exclaimed. “We will start
immediately!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eddie had remained at home to eat his supper when
Gran’pa went for the boat, and now he came running over just
in time to see the Flying Boat rise from the ground and go
sailing over the fences and trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll take care of your place until you come back!” he
yelled.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Gran’pa and Gran’ma, increasing the speed of the
Flying Boat, were soon only a speck in the sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they had reached a great altitude, Gran’pa twisted
the spool marked “Direction taken by the children” and the
Flying Boat swooped down towards the earth until it was on
a plane with the course taken by Janey and Johnny; then, as
Gran’pa twisted the “Speed” spool, the Flying Boat whizzed
through the air so fast that the wind screamed as it rushed in
and out of the chinks in the wing boards. Gran’pa and
Gran’ma saw the sun rise as they flew over the horizon. The
side of the earth away from the sun was in darkness, so that
when they flew higher it took on the appearance of a half moon.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
<img src='images/i_042a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa looked at his watch and said it was ten-thirty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You take a wink of sleep, Gran’ma,” he said. “I’ll keep
watch!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Gran’ma rolled up in the blankets she had placed in
the boat and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa awakened her in about an hour to look at the
Moon, which they were approaching at great speed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They must have gone to the Moon!” Gran’ma cried.
“No, they must have changed their course!” she added after
a moment as the Flying Boat, following the course taken by
the children, made the circuit of the Moon.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Flying Boat soon flew directly at the Moon and
the old folks knew the children must have made a landing
there.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_042b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>In fact, the Flying Boat soon landed near the Flying
Machine that Johnny had made.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here we are!” Gran’pa cried, as he helped Gran’ma from
the Flying Boat. “See where they have been sitting in the
grass!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Gran’ma and Gran’pa followed the children’s path in
the grass until they came to the spring. There they saw the
signs of Johnny’s fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It looks as though a struggle had taken place here!” cried
Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! Maybe wild beasts have eaten them up!” cried
Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! There are no signs of wild beasts!” Gran’pa replied.
“We should see their torn clothes about if that were the case!
See, their trail leads off this way!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa and Gran’ma at last came to the tiny house of
sticks and mud and heard the cries of the children inside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here we are!” Gran’pa cried as he ran around the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma, lifting her skirts, followed, and when she turned
the corner of the house she stopped in amazement beside
Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>Back of the house the Strange Man was running in circles
and dodging behind trees and bushes, now this way and now
that, while right behind him came a Faun Boy with lowered
head. They were so busy running they didn’t notice Gran’ma
and Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>And as the old couple watched, the little Faun Boy caught
up with the Strange Man and, butting him with all his might,
sent him flying through a bunch of ferns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the Strange Man could regain his feet the Faun
Boy was upon him and sent him tumbling head over heels
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Strange Man scrambled to his feet when the Faun Boy
tripped over some vines and without looking behind him he
circled about and ran for the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he reached the door, another Faun Boy rushed from the
bushes and, taking the Strange Man unawares, sent him flying
back towards the first Faun Boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those goats will butt him to pieces!” cried Gran’ma, as
she ran after the Faun Boys and tried to shoo them away.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Faun Boys paid no attention to Gran’ma’s shooing
and continued to butt the Strange Man about between them
until he scarcely had time to know from which side he was
attacked.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Gran’pa saw that Gran’ma’s shooing had no effect
upon the Faun Boys, Gran’pa ran after them and managed to
catch their arms, and although they struggled to get free he
held them tightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My gracious!” Gran’pa asked them, “Do you wish to kill
that poor old man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us go!” the Faun Boys cried, “He’s a wicked
magician!”</p>

<div id='little'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_045.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>The little Faun Boy caught up with the Strange Man, hitting him with all his might. (page <a href='#Page_44'>44</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“I thought they were goats,” Gran’ma exclaimed, and she
looked hard at the Faun Boys as she adjusted her glasses, “but
they <i>are</i> part boys!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Strange Man had managed to get to his feet and without
thanking Gran’pa, who still held the Faun Boys, he slipped
through the bushes and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two Faun Boys began crying. “He was a wicked
magician!” they said, “and he changed us partly into goats.
We are trying to get him to change us back to our own shapes!
Now you have spoiled it all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me!” Gran’ma cried, as she caught the two Faun
Boys in her arms. “Gran’pa, you should have known better!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know I should have known better now, but I didn’t until
they told me!” Gran’pa said. “I’m very sorry!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_047.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Just then Janey and Johnny, who had stopped yelling to
rest a little, started up again and Gran’pa and Gran’ma ran
towards the house.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The door was locked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Open the door and we will let you out!” cried Gran’pa
when he could make himself heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are tied, hands and feet,” Johnny yelled, “and we
can’t get to the door!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Besides, it’s locked on the outside!” Janey called.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s get a fence rail and break in the door!” said Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there wasn’t a fence in sight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll run back to the Flying Boat and get a
hatchet!” Gran’pa called, as he started away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt you will find that old Jingles, the Magician,
intended changing your grandchildren into animals,”
the Faun Boys told Gran’ma.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“If I had him now!” Gran’ma said, stamping her foot upon
the ground, “I’d tweak his long nose! That’s what I’d do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally Gran’pa came running back all out of breath.
“The Flying Boat and the children’s Flying Machine are both
gone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh dear!” Gran’ma exclaimed, as she sat down on the
ground and began crying.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Faun Boys began butting their heads against the door,
Gran’pa helping them by throwing his shoulder against it, and
soon the door gave way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma and Gran’pa untied the children and hugged
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The children told Gran’ma and Gran’pa of their experience.
“As soon as he had learned the rhyme he was going to change
us into pigs!” Janey said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, we won’t let him now that we are here!” said,
Gran’ma, firmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, but you couldn’t help yourself if he decided to change
you into animals!” the Faun Boys told Gran’ma.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“I’d like to see him just try it!” Gran’ma said, her lips in
a tight line. “I’d tweek his nose out of joint!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps we’d better leave the place before he returns!”
Gran’pa said. “Evidently it was Jingles the Magician who
took our Flying Boat!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely it must have been!” the Faun Boys said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here’s his large book, with the verses in, that he uses to
work his magic with!” cried Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>The book was too large for them to carry with them, so they
hid it under some stones and scattered leaves over it so that
Jingles would not be able to find it if he came back.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Enter the Magic Boxing Gloves, the Wolves, and the Rubber River</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“The Strange Man is called ‘Jingles the Magician’
because he uses rhymes to work his magic,” the Faun
Boys explained, as they walked from the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had not gone far before they reached a large field.
“This is queer!” one of the Faun Boys cried. “This field was
not here when we came through a short time ago!”</p>

<p class='c010'>About half-way across the field was a clump of bushes, and
Gran’pa said, “Perhaps it would be as well to walk around it.”
But as they drew nearer the bushes began moving, and what
seemed at first to be a flock of birds arose and flew towards
them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>As the objects came closer Gran’pa saw they were Boxing
Gloves; swarms of them. They flew about the little group
and peppered them from all sides. Gran’pa struck them right
and left with his cane, but was finally forced down. The children,
Gran’ma and the Faun Boys ran as fast as they could
across the field, followed by the Boxing Gloves, which
swarmed about their heads like giant bees and hit against their
backs and heads.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa, still on the ground, struck right and left with his
heavy cane and at each swing he brought down one or two of
the Boxing Gloves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The children, Gran’ma and the Faun Boys by this time had
reached the other side of the field and dashed into the underbrush.
For some reason the Boxing Gloves did not follow, but
turned and flew back and began pelting Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whenever Gran’pa managed to get to his feet the Boxing
Gloves knocked him down, so he lay on his back and struck
right and left and kicked his heels in the air to keep them from
striking him.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Johnny saw that the Boxing Gloves did not follow
into the underbrush he told Gran’ma and Janey to wait where
they were and breaking off a stout stick Johnny rushed back
to Gran’pa’s assistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stick was so long and heavy that he tripped over it, but
he didn’t mind that—just jumped up and ran faster than ever.</p>

<div id='Gran'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_053.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>Gran’pa struck them right and left with his cane, but was finally knocked down. (page <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Some of the Boxing Gloves met him half-way and
although Johnny knocked them down by the hundreds, he
could not defend himself from all sides and three or four of
the Boxing Gloves, striking him from behind, sent him flying
to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny rolled over and over, but kept his stout stick
thrashing the air whenever he turned face up.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa was still hitting the Boxing Gloves with his
cane, but was getting very tired.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ground was covered with broken Boxing Gloves, lying
where Gran’pa and Johnny had struck them with their sticks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny tried to get upon his feet, but was promptly knocked
down. The Faun Boys broke off large sticks and ran back into
the field, where they fought the Boxing Gloves away from
Gran’pa and Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Faun Boys whipped so many of the Boxing Gloves
that soon there were not enough left to injure Gran’pa and
Johnny again, so as the few remaining Boxing Gloves flew
at them Gran’pa and Johnny whipped these, too.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last there were only three of the Boxing Gloves left and
these were flying about one of the Faun Boys, trying to find a
place to strike him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa ran to his assistance and as he struck at them one
flew close and knocked Gran’pa’s glasses from his nose, so that
he could not see.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Watch for my glasses, boys!” he cried. “Don’t step on
them!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Johnny, running up, cracked one of the Boxing Gloves,
but the other two kept getting behind him. Presently Johnny
found himself with his back towards the Faun Boys, and a
Boxing Glove coming to reach the Faun Boy did not know
Johnny was there until Johnny caught it such a whack with
his stick he tore it all to pieces. The Faun Boy finally knocked
the thumb off the last one and the great fight with the Magic
Boxing Gloves was over.</p>

<p class='c010'>What a sight! There were thousands of torn Boxing
Gloves lying about.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the Faun Boys found Gran’pa’s glasses and handed
them to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was better than fighting bumble bees when I was a
boy!” Gran’pa laughed. Aside from a black and blue eye,
Gran’pa was not hurt in the least.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That surely was fun!” Johnny cried, as they reached the
place where they had left Janey and Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It won’t be as much fun the next time!” a voice cried,
and turning, they saw old Jingles the Magician sail from the
Boxing Glove Bushes in the Flying Boat and disappear in the
direction of his house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought he was responsible for those bushes!” said one
of the Faun Boys. “You must watch out for him every minute,
for all he has to do to change you into an animal is to puff
his magic powder on you and say his rhyme!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will watch out for him!” Gran’ma said.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The Faun Boys invited Gran’ma and Gran’pa and the children
to their place to rest and have something to eat, so they
led the way and without further adventure came to their tiny
home.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Faun Boys had given Gran’pa and Gran’ma and
the children food, Gran’pa said, “I don’t know how we shall
contrive to get the flying boat away from old Jingles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should advise you not to try it,” one of the Faun Boys
told him, “for he will only change you into animals if he once
gets you separated from each other! I should advise you to
travel in the opposite direction from his place until you come
to the town of Nite. Living in that town you will find an old
Witch who may be able to help you reach the earth again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps that will be a wise thing to do!” Gran’ma said.
“For if we should get separated and one of us should be
changed to an animal, the rest of us could not go home without
him and we could not take him home!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” Janey and Johnny said, “let us go to the City of
Nite!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So, thanking the Faun Boys for their hospitality, Gran’ma
and Gran’pa and Janey and Johnny left them and started on
their journey.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Faun Boys had warned them to be careful of old
Jingles.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He may follow you all the way to the City of Nite and
try to get each of you alone so he can say his rhymes,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>they said, “but once you are
in the City you are safe, for
we have heard that the Witch
is very angry at him and will
destroy him some day if she
can!”</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>After leaving the home of
the Faun Boys, Gran’ma with
her arm about Janey and
Gran’pa with his arm around
Johnny, the travelers walked
until they came to a high cliff
above a river. There seemed
to be no way across to the other
side of the canyon except by
way of a Vine Bridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can never get across that
thing!” Gran’ma cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll have to cross it or
walk for miles and miles
around!” Gran’pa said. For as
far as they could see in either
direction, the canyon was just
as wide and deep as it was there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I just know I’d get dizzy
and tumble in!” Gran’ma said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
<img src='images/i_059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Johnny walked out upon the vine
bridge and bounced it up and down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is strong enough to hold us,
Gran’ma!” he called back. “Put
your hands over your eyes and you
will be all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t do it!” Gran’ma replied,
as she sat down on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we only had our boat we’d
fly across!” Janey said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes! If we only had our boat
we’d fly home!” Gran’ma sighed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe, after all, we had best
go back to the wicked Jingle’s house
until he goes to bed and then we may
be able to get our boat!” Gran’pa
suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps we had!” Johnny
agreed. So they turned from the canyon
and started to retrace their steps.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Suddenly Gran’pa, who was in the lead, stopped and said,
“Listen! What was that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>They all held their breaths an instant later. It was the
baying of Wolves.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are coming in this direction!” Johnny cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound grew louder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which way shall we go?” Janey asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on everybody!” Gran’ma cried, as she lifted her
skirts and ran towards the Vine Bridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait, Gran’ma!” Janey cried. “Let Johnny help you
across!” But Gran’ma kept running.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as she reached the edge of the canyon she stumbled
and slid over the cliff.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa, Johnny and Janey ran to the edge and looked
over, expecting to see Gran’ma struggling in the river far
below, but what was their surprise to see her sitting upon the
top of the water, unharmed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you hurt?” Gran’pa called.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a speck!” Gran’ma called back. “The river is
rubber and all I did was bounce up and down!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jump over and have a bounce! I wish I were up there so
I could do it again! It was fine!” Gran’ma added, as she
jumped up and down and bounced about like a rubber ball.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa had almost forgotten the Wolves coming behind
them, but noticing now how near they seemed, he said, “We
haven’t a great deal of time left, Johnny, we better jump!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The Wolves have scented us and are getting closer every
minute!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But if we get down there, how will we ever get up
again?” Johnny wondered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know!” Gran’pa exclaimed, “but I know I shall
not leave Gran’ma down there alone!” So with that, Gran’pa
jumped from the cliff and turned over and over before he hit
the Rubber River upon his back.</p>

<p class='c010'>The children thought he never would stop bouncing.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time the children could see the Wolves in the distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What shall we do?” Janey cried, wringing her hands.
“If we jump down we may never get up again, if we stay
here we shall be caught by the Wolves, and if we go across they
will follow us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We could go across and then, when the Wolves tried to
follow, we could bounce the Vine Bridge and shake them off!”
Johnny suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and shake them down to Gran’ma and Gran’pa!
No, Johnny, that will never do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you cross the Vine Bridge, Sis, and I’ll show you
what we’ll do! Hurry now, before it’s too late!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey ran across the Vine Bridge, and when she had reached
the other side Johnny drew his knife from his pocket and
hacked at the vines. The small, sharp blade soon cut them in
two. He was none too quick, for just as he severed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the last strand of the Vine Bridge
the Leader of the Wolves sprang toward
Johnny.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_062.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>As the Vine Bridge fell Johnny jumped
and caught the loose end and went swinging
across the chasm at a dizzy speed. He
managed to hold on, even if he did get quite
a bump when the Vine Bridge struck on the
other side.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Leader of the Wolves jumped
and missed Johnny, he flew headlong over
the cliff. Gran’pa was watching the children,
but when he saw the Wolf light upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the Rubber River he braced himself and brought his stout cane
down upon the Wolf’s head with such force it did not move
a muscle when it had ceased bouncing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma, thinking the whole pack of Wolves would follow
their Leader, ran to the side of the Rubber River and disappeared
in a hole in the cliff.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa followed her, and it was well he did, for as soon
as Gran’ma and he started to run the Wolves jumped over the
cliff to the Rubber River.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time the Wolves had quit bouncing Gran’pa was in
the hole beside Gran’ma, and together they had rolled a large
stone across the opening so the Wolves could not follow.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for Johnny, he swung to the other side of the canyon,
climbed up the Vine Bridge and finally reached the top where
Janey was sitting waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh Johnny,” she cried, “the Wolves jumped over the
cliff after Gran’ma and Gran’pa! Look and see if you can see
them anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny had been so busy climbing he had known nothing
of what had happened below.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now he went to the edge and looked over. The Wolves
were all at one spot on the cliff.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh dear!” he cried. “They probably have caught
Gran’ma and Gran’pa!”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this Janey came to the edge and looked. She watched
the pack closely for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“No, they have not! See! The Wolves are tearing and
digging at that big stone. Gran’ma and Gran’pa must be
behind the stone! There must be a cave there!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny caught his sister by the shoulder and drew her
hastily away from the edge of the cliff and into the bushes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Old Jingles in the Flying Boat!” he whispered. “I just
saw a speck in the distance, coming this way!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So the children, crouching low, ran away through the ferns
and bushes.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Beautiful Girl Tells Her Strange Story</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>As soon as Gran’pa and Gran’ma rolled the stone
across the opening they walked back into the cave. It
was very dark and they held their hands in front of
them so they would not bump their heads if they ran into a
wall. By and by Gran’pa came to some steps, and feeling his
way with his cane he helped Gran’ma up the long flight. They
finally reached the top and walked into a spacious cavern
filled with a greenish light. They could not discover where
the light came from, but they could see each other quite plainly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa and Gran’ma walked across the cavern until they
came to a door over which hung a sign which read, “Stay out!
This means you!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“We may as well go in!” Gran’pa said, “for we cannot
get out while the Wolves are at the opening!” So hand in
hand they entered the door and followed a narrow passageway
as it zigzagged back and forth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently they came to a round room filled with a reddish
light, and in the center of this room stood a large pot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa went up to the pot and raised the lid. As he did
so the lid sprang from his hands and flew across the room. The
pot began popping like a bunch of firecrackers, and white stuff
flew from it up to the ceiling and rattled down about the place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa and Gran’ma could not find the entrance to the
room again, although they went around the room four or five
times.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa discovered a hole far above their heads, and as the
white stuff flew about them like hail and settled upon the floor,
they kept climbing on top of it until they could reach the hole
and climb through.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they crawled into the hole something warm and sticky
flowed by them, so they hurried back into the room from which
they had just come. It was lucky for them that they did, for
the sticky stuff poured from the hole in a stream and mixed
with the white stuff which now nearly filled the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s molasses!” Gran’pa cried, as he tasted it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the white stuff is popcorn!” Gran’ma cried in turn,
as she took up a handful and squeezed it together into a popcorn
ball.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The molasses candy continued to pour from the hole until
the popcorn was covered with it. Then the room began to sway
back and forth, gently at first, then faster and faster, until
Gran’pa, popcorn and Gran’ma were shaken up and rolled
about much the same as popcorn is in a shaker. Both Gran’pa
and Gran’ma were covered with molasses and popcorn when
the room ceased shaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me suz!” Gran’ma exclaimed. “The stuff is all in
my hair!—This is a mess!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but just taste it, Gran’ma!” Gran’pa said. “It’s
fine!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the room began shaking and the air grew much
warmer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’d better get out of this!” Gran’pa said. “There must
be a fire under the room!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So they crawled through the hole again and now the
molasses candy had grown hard and did not stick to their
hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This must be the place the molasses came from,” said
Gran’ma, as they came to another room, the sides of which were
covered with candy.</p>

<p class='c010'>There seemed to be no opening at the top for the candy to
come in and Gran’pa soon discovered that it came in from the
bottom.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the hard candy at the side of the room Gran’ma
thought she saw a light, and when Gran’pa pried a large piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>away with his cane they saw another long, narrow opening.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_068.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Through this they crawled until the passageway widened
and they could stand up and walk.</p>

<p class='c010'>After walking down this passageway for five or ten minutes
Gran’pa and Gran’ma came to a room filled with purple light,
and in the center of this room stood a large Green Jar.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well I won’t be foolish enough to look in this one!”
Gran’pa said, as he walked right past it and opened a door
upon the other side. “Here we are, Gran’ma! I can see daylight,
and the steps lead up to the top of the ground.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that is the case, I shall take a peep in this Green Jar!”
Gran’ma said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t do it, Gran’ma!” Gran’pa cautioned. “Profit by
our last experience!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but the other was a pot, and pots are always apt to
boil over or do something of the sort,” Gran’ma answered. “I
shall look into this Green Jar and you can hold the door wide
open, like this, so it won’t take a moment to drop it and hurry
up the steps and escape if it begins to blow popcorn or do anything
of the kind.”</p>

<div id='Did'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_069.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>“Did you open the Green Jar?” the Beautiful Girl asked. (page <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Gran’ma took the lid from the Green Jar and thick red
smoke came whirling up from it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma wished to run, but her knees would not let her,
so she sat right down, smack! upon the floor and watched.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the smoke thinned out Gran’ma saw the hands, then
the arms, then the head of a Beautiful Girl appear above the
edge of the Green Jar.</p>

<p class='c010'>She raised her arms above her head and yawned.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Gran’pa saw what was coming from the Green Jar
he came back and helped Gran’ma to her feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Beautiful Girl turned and looked at them. “Who are
you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gran’ma and Gran’pa Huggins!” Gran’pa said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you open the Green Jar?” the Beautiful Girl asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gran’ma did,” Gran’pa answered, “but I advised her
not to!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, seeing that she opened it anyway I shall forgive
you, Gran’pa!” the Beautiful Girl laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall we help you out?” Gran’ma asked, as she held out
her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mercy, how sticky you are!” the Beautiful Girl cried.
“We were caught in a popcorn machine!” Gran’pa
laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Beautiful Girl had been helped from the Green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Jar, Gran’pa led the way to the door and up the stairs to the
ground above.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa, Gran’ma and the Beautiful Girl came right out
where Janey and Johnny were hiding. The children flew to
the old people and threw their arms around their necks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Old Jingles sent the Wolf Pack after us,” Johnny said,
“for we saw him flying this way after you two had crawled
into the cave!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps he will follow us into the cave!” said Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope he sticks fast in the molasses candy if he does!”
said Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us fill the opening here with stones!” Johnny suggested,
“so if he does follow you through the cave he will have
to go all the way back for his trouble!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So they all carried sticks and stones and filled up the
mouth of the cave. When that was finished Janey asked
where they had found the Beautiful Girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us travel from here as fast as we can!” said the Beautiful
Girl, “and I will tell you the story as we go along!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As they hurried through the giant mushrooms and bushes
the Beautiful Girl told them the following strange story.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I live in the City of Nite,” she began, “or at least I did
live there until I was shut up in the Green Jar. I was out
walking one day near the river, and as I stopped on the bank
to gather some beautiful flowers growing there I came upon a
Queer Horse standing in the water. At first I thought he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>not be alive, for he stood so still and he had no head; but as I
stood gazing at him in wonderment he switched his tail and
knocked some flies from his back, and I heard him say, ‘There
now! I hope I switched all of you off!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Dear me!’ I cried out aloud. ‘A horse without a head
talking! Whoever heard of such a thing!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“At this the Queer Horse came out of the water and sat
down upon the bank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I don’t see how you are able to travel about without a
head!’ I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Well, it is a handicap,’ the Queer Horse answered, ‘but
I have grown used to it!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Where is your head?’” I asked him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I ate it off!’ he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Ate it off!’” I exclaimed in wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Yes!’ he replied. ‘You see, I was always a sort of pig
when it came to eating, and one day a Strange Man came up
to me and hit me with his cane and cried, “If you don’t quit
your eating you’ll burst! I believe if you were given all you
could eat, you would eat your head off!”’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I should like to have a trial at it!’ I answered the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Then,’ he said, ‘You shall have it!’ and he led me to a
field where hay and corn and oats grew thick! ‘Now,’ said the
Strange Man, ‘Eat!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘So I ate and ate, until I really did eat my head off!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And,” continued the Beautiful Girl, “I felt so sorry for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the Queer Horse I went up and patted him where his head
should have been, and, lo! and behold, his head came into
view!</p>

<p class='c010'>“At this the Queer Horse was very happy, and told me he
was very grateful to me. ‘If I can ever be of assistance to you,
I shall be very glad!’ he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And as we stood there talking the Strange Man came up
to us and said, ‘Why did you pat the Queer Horse where his
head wasn’t?’”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_074.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“‘I don’t know!’ I replied. ‘I just felt sorry for him and
wished to pat him!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You’ve spoiled my magic!’ the Strange Man said, ‘and
as punishment you will have to be shut up in the Green Jar!’
And he struck me with his cane.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not know another thing until you took the lid off
the Green Jar,” the Beautiful Girl told Gran’ma, as she ended
her tale.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you don’t know how long you were in the Green
Jar?” asked the children.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I have no recollection of any time at all. It just
seems as if I had gone to sleep and just awakened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never knew such things were possible,” Gran’pa
exclaimed, “until we came here, to the Magical Land of
Noom!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you live on the Moon?” the Beautiful Girl asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” Gran’ma answered, “we just came to the Moon.
We live upon the Earth, and we shall be very glad when we
can get back there, too, I tell you!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_075.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Why don’t you return to the Earth?” the Beautiful Girl
inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Old Jingles, the Magician, took our Flying Boat!” said
Gran’pa. “And we are trying to escape from him now, or get
our Flying Boat back, or do something, so that we can return
to the Earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen!” the Beautiful Girl cried suddenly. “What
was that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It sounded like thunder,” Janey said. “There comes the
storm cloud!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us hasten!” the Beautiful Girl cried. “Perhaps we
may find shelter somewhere!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So, catching hold of hands, they all ran as hard as they
could until they came to a village.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here’s a good place!” the girl cried, as she ran in at an
open door.</p>

<p class='c010'>They reached shelter none too soon, for the storm was upon
them.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Now We Come to the Little Old Lady and Jingle’s Magic Whistle</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The wind howled, and the lightning popped and cracked,
and everything grew as black as ink. The rain came
down in torrents and the house in which they had taken
shelter rocked and shook.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if anyone lives here!” Gran’ma said, as she felt
around the walls and turned on a light.</p>

<p class='c010'>The room was flooded with brightness, and the Beautiful
Girl saw a paper lying on a table and picked it up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh dear me!” she cried, as she sat down on a chair and
buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Gran’ma ran to her and put her arms around her. “What
is the matter, my dear?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look at the date on this paper!” wept the Beautiful Girl.
Gran’ma read, “July 24, 339,780.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t understand!” said Gran’ma as the others came
and stood around the Beautiful Girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was in the year 339,700 that I talked to the Queer
Horse and the Strange Man put me in the jar! Oh dear! I
have been in that jar for eighty years!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s one consolation,” said Gran’pa, gallantly, “you
do not look it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it!” the Beautiful Girl replied, “We never
change much here. I did not tell you before, you see, that I
am Princess Nidia of Nite, and that there has been no one to
rule the City of Nite in all this time!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, there has!” Gran’ma cried. “For the Faun Boys
told us there was an old Witch who ruled things in the City
of Nite!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I am lost!” the Beautiful Girl cried. “For she
will never let me have my throne back again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will take it away from her!” said Johnny. “It
belongs to you and we will help you get it back! And we shall
call you The Princess from now on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you can get my throne back,” the Princess said, as
Gran’ma wiped the tears from her eyes. “I cannot imagine
who this Witch can be!”</p>

<div id='It'  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic005'>
<p>“It was in the year 339,700 that I talked to the Queer Horse and the Strange Man put me in the jar!” (page <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“The Faun Boys told us that the Witch was an enemy of
old Jingles, the wicked Magician,” said Janey, “so perhaps
the Witch has just been holding your throne for you until you
return!”</p>

<p class='c010'>While they had been talking the storm had increased in
fury so that the windows rattled as if they would fall out.</p>

<p class='c010'>A leak started in the roof and water dripped to the floor,
where it spread on the carpet and made a black spot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is one of our ink rains!” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma ran to the kitchen and got a large tub which she
placed where it would catch the ink and save the carpet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you very much for doing that!” said a voice from
the other side of the room. “I feel sure anyone kind enough to
do and act like that would not harm a poor Little Old Lady!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed we wouldn’t harm you!” Gran’pa said. “But
where are you hiding?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Up here!” said the Little Old Lady, as she looked out
from behind a picture which covered a window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a door behind the cabinet there, and if you press
the little button at the side you will see a stairway! Perhaps
you would be more comfortable up here!”</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_081.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Shall we go up?” asked Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, let’s go up and see her,” the
children replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Johnny hunted until he found
the tiny button, and the cabinet swung
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>out from the wall, disclosing the thoroughly scoured stairway.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they were all on the inside the cabinet swung back
into place, and the little doorway was hidden.</p>

<p class='c010'>They went up the stairs and came into a very pretty little
room with soft chairs and couches standing about.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Make yourselves comfortable,” said the Little Old Lady,
“while I get you a bite to eat and a cup of tea!”</p>

<p class='c010'>From the coziness of the little room the storm could hardly
be heard, and the visitors were happy, watching the Little Old
Lady as she worked.</p>

<p class='c010'>She wore a tiny little poke bonnet and a tight waist with
an enormous overskirt of flowered material. Two cheery eyes
full of twinkles looked out through shiny eyeglasses, and a
stray white curl peeped out from beneath the back of her
bonnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I heard you come running up the path, I hid,”
the Little Old Lady said when the tea was ready, “for no one
would suspect that I had a room up here and nothing would
disturb me in my retreat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When all had eaten and Gran’ma had cleaned up the
crumbs and started to wash the dishes, they were all startled
by a loud thumping down stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sh!” whispered the Little Old Lady. “Sit still while I
take a peek!” She turned out the light and went to the picture
and peeped through. Then she closed the picture window and
turned on the light.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Sh!” she whispered again. “Didn’t I hear you talking
of a wicked man? Come and see if it is he; but remember, do
not make the slightest noise or he will discover us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>When all had peeped through the picture window, and the
kind old lady had closed it again the Princess said, “It is
indeed the wicked Strange Man who put me in the jar!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is old Jingles, the Magician!” whispered the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, it was old Jingles, the Magician, but he was a very
sorry sight. His clothes were covered with black mud and the
ink rain had soaked through his hat and had run down over his
face so that it was as black as coal.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stamped his feet to shake the ink from his clothes, and
wiped his face with his handkerchief; but the more he wiped
it the blacker it grew.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Little Old Lady again motioned the rest to the window
and turned out the light so that they could watch old
Jingles.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just wait until I catch them!” he muttered to himself.
“I will change all of them into pigs and never let them see a
mud puddle! I should have been all right if Gran’ma and
Gran’pa had not come along! It’s all their fault, and it was
they who rescued the Princess from the Green Jar! Oh, just
wait until I catch them! Then they will be sorry they ever
came to the Magical Land of Noom!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The wicked creature tried saying some of his magic rhymes
to clean the ink from himself, but he did not succeed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“I should have had all of them in my power by this time
if the ink rain had not soaked my little Magic Whistle so that
I cannot blow it!” And he took something from out of his
pocket and wiped it with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a Magic Whistle made of pig-skin and had little
tassels hanging from it. Now the pig-skin was soaking wet
and the tassels dripping ink. The more the Magician wiped
the whistle, the wetter it seemed to become.</p>

<p class='c010'>The storm had slackened by this time and old Jingles went
to the window. “They cannot have gone far!” he said as he
shook his fist at the black clouds disappearing in the distance,
“and no matter how far they have gone, I will catch up with
them when my Magic Whistle dries! And then they had better
be careful!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the rain of ink had now ceased, the Magician went to
the door and looked out. “I hope it will dry up soon,” he said,
“so that I can catch up with them!” And he walked out of
the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What had we better do?” Gran’ma asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had best stay where we are for a while,” Gran’pa
replied, “for evidently the ink rain has covered our tracks and
he will not be able to find us, so he will go on and we can
follow him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must hasten to the City of Nite,” cried the Princess,
“and try to regain my throne. My subjects were so happy
when I was there—oh, dear, I wonder how it will all turn out!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Perhaps the Little Old Lady can suggest something for
us to do,” Janey said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Little Old Lady thought a while and then said, “I
believe it will be as well for all of you to stay here for a time.
That will throw Jingles off the track. I will run over to my
brothers and ask their advice. I think it would be as well for
all of you to stay in this room, meanwhile, in case the Magician
should return!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the Little Old Lady went down a back stairway and
out of the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I had known what trouble we should get into, I should
never have built the Flying Machine!” said Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not take all the blame, Johnny,” said his sister, “for
it was I who thought of most of it and then we really did not
know it would fly!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_085.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Little Old Lady was gone for quite a while and as the
others sat talking in the cozy secret room, they again heard
stamping downstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma went to the picture window and peeped through.
Old Jingles had returned. “I can not find their trail beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>this house!” he cried as he kicked over a chair. “If my Magic
Whistle would only dry so that I could blow it and discover
where they are, I could easily catch up with them and punish
them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me!” Gran’ma whispered to the others who had
gathered around the picture window to listen. “The wicked
Magician seems to think we have done something very mean
to him, when we are only trying to escape his clutches!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is always the case,” said the Princess. “Those who
do the most harm always think they are the most abused when
things do not go just as they wish!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope his Magic Whistle warps out of shape so that
when it blows it will turn his magic right back on himself!”
Johnny whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>The more the Magician thought of our friends escaping
him the more injured he felt, and he knocked the furniture
about in his anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he kicked the cabinet and loosened the little button
which opened the door. “Hello!” he cried. “Here is a secret
stairway!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quick!” cried Gran’ma. “He has discovered the stairway!
He is coming up! Run down the back way quick!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They all ran down the back stairs as fast as they could, and
of course they made a lot of noise running. The more quietly
they tried to run the more they tripped and stumbled. The
Magician, hearing them, knew in a moment who it was and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>sprang up the front stairway in pursuit. Then down the back
stairs he ran too.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Gran’pa, Gran’ma, the Princess and Janey ran down
the street they saw the Little Old Lady running towards them
with her three brothers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny, bracing himself at the back door, was trying to
hold it so the Magician could not get out and he did succeed
in holding him back until the others got a good start.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Magician finally forced the door open, Johnny
took to his heels with the long-legged Magician close behind
him. Johnny dodged this way and that until he almost caught
up with the others, who, when they met the Little Old Lady
and her brothers had stood still.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_087.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Just as the Magician was
reaching out his hand to catch
hold of Johnny’s collar,
Johnny remembered a trick he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>had learned with other boys and dropped to his knees, right
in front of the Magician.</p>

<p class='c010'>This tripped up Old Jingles and he went sprawling head
over heels. As he rolled over the three brothers of the Little
Old Lady pounced upon him and held him so he could not
move.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Magician rolled his eyes and started to say a rhyme,
but one of the brothers clapped his hand over Jingles’ mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then while two of the brothers held the Magician down,
the other ran to the house and came back with ropes. Soon the
Magician was tied so that he could not move a muscle and a
handkerchief was tied across his mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time many people had gathered about and it was
suggested that Old Jingles be given a seat in the ducking pool.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now,” said the Little Old Lady, “you folks had better
be on your way! We will keep the Magician here as long as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Gran’pa, Gran’ma, Johnny, Janey and the Princess
stayed only long enough to see the Magician soused up and
down in the water two or three times and then they hastened
out of town.</p>

<p class='c010'>The brothers ducked the wicked Magician up and down in
the pond until they grew tired, then others took their places
and they kept this up for two hours. Then the Magician was
placed in the stocks and his hands and feet firmly padlocked so
that he could not get away.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Soft-Voiced Cow Meets the Witch and the Invisible People</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>After leaving the village in which the Magician was
a prisoner, Gran’ma, Gran’pa, the Princess and the
children ran until they were tired, and coming to a
quiet shady place they sat down to rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not believe I have run so hard since I was a girl,”
said Gran’ma as she fanned herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then they heard a noise in the bushes and all sprang
to their feet, but sat down again with sighs of relief when a
Cow walked up to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cow wore a pretty bonnet and a velour waist; her skirt
was of velvet with flowers embroidered around the edge.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>As she came up to the little group she shook the wrinkles
out of her apron and sat down facing them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you do, everybody!” the Cow said in a soft voice,
as she smiled at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Everybody greeted the Soft-Voiced Cow in a kindly
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw you running across the field,” said the Soft-Voiced
Cow, “and you looked as if you were running away from something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We were,” Gran’ma said. “We were running away
from Old Jingles the Magician, who wants to change us into
animals.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me suz!” exclaimed the Soft-Voiced Cow. “Is he
that wicked?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes indeed he is,” Janey said, and she told of their experiences,
and of that of the Princess.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he follows you, he may find me when he comes this
way,” said the Soft-Voiced Cow. “So if you do not mind my
company, I will go with you to the City of Nite. I should not
care to meet so wicked a Magician.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We should be greatly pleased to have your company,”
they told the Soft-Voiced Cow.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they had rested, Gran’pa said they better begin
travel on; so the Soft-Voiced Cow took Gran’ma and the
Princess and Janey on her back and the little party started on
their way.</p>

<div id='Old'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_091.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>The Old Woman caught the Soft-Voiced Cow’s tail and began dragging her back. (Page <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>They passed through dense groves of giant mushrooms
and at times these were so thick they had to bend them to one
side in order to pass.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they grew hungry the children told Gran’ma and
Gran’pa that the mushrooms were cake, so they ate of these.</p>

<p class='c010'>After leaving the forest of mushrooms the path led through
very rocky country and as they turned a cliff the party came
upon a spring bubbling from the rocks and splashing down into
a small stream far below.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were a number of cups near the spring, so the
children ran up and took a drink. “Oh hurry!” they cried,
“It’s a soda water spring!”</p>

<p class='c010'>After drinking all they wished they again set out upon
their journey. When they finally left the rocky country and
came upon a level stretch of road they saw approaching them
an Old Woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma, the Princess and Janey had dismounted from
the back of the Soft-Voiced Cow, for they did not wish to tire
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Old Woman came up to them, she caught the
Soft-Voiced Cow by the tail and began dragging her back the
way the party had come.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa was for making her let go of the Soft-Voiced Cow’s
tail, but the Soft-Voiced Cow spoke gently and said, “Let her
be; she is evidently an ill mannered person or she would not
treat a stranger in this manner!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>However, the Old Woman dragged the Soft-Voiced Cow
down the road so fast the friction of the cow’s feet upon the
roadway made them burn.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the Soft-Voiced Cow turned to the Old Woman and
said, “I wish you would please let go of my tail! I do not
care to travel in the direction you are taking me and besides
you are making my feet burn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Old Woman kept right on and paid no attention to
the cow.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Soft-Voiced Cow had been dragged back upon
the road for about a mile with the little party following her,
the Soft-Voiced Cow turned her head to the Old Woman and
said in her gentle way, “My dear lady, I must insist that you
let go of my tail, for you are delaying our party! We wish to
go in the opposite direction! And if you drag me three more
steps, I shall have to raise my heels and upset you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this, Gran’pa caught the Old Woman’s arm and said,
“Why do you drag the Soft-Voiced Cow in this manner?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Woman stopped and gazed at Gran’pa for a moment,
“Does this Cow belong to you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not!” Gran’pa replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does she belong to anyone in your party?” the Old
Woman asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not!” Gran’pa replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” said the Old Woman, “in that case, the Cow
does not belong to you nor anyone else that you know of, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>she must be lost. And anything which is lost belongs to the
one who finds it! Therefore, since I found the Cow she
belongs to me, so I will take her home and make ox tail soup
out of her!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you ever hear the like?” cried the Princess. “Do
not let her take the Soft-Voiced Cow to make soup of!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Woman again began dragging the Soft-Voiced
Cow down the road.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stand aside!” said the Soft-Voiced Cow. “ONE, TWO,
THREE! There!” She raised her heels in the air and upset
the Old Woman. “I promised that I would do it if you
dragged me three more steps!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Woman scrambled to her feet and shook her fist
at Gran’ma. “You will pay for this!” she cried. “Just
wait!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_095.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>And as the travelers and the Soft-Voiced Cow resumed their
journey, the Old Woman followed right behind them muttering
in an undertone, “You will pay for this!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>When they had gone but a little way beyond the place
where they had met the Old Woman, Johnny who was ahead
of the others found ten cans. With these he came running
back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here are ten cans of ox tail soup!” he said, as he offered
them to the Old Woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want them!” the Old Woman cried. “I want the
Soft-Voiced Cow and I will have her if I have to follow you
all around the Moon!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are a most unreasonable Old Woman!” said the
Princess. “You don’t try to be happy! When you get what
you want it seems to make you discontented!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Woman did not answer, but ran around the party
and down the road ahead of them. “You just wait!” she cried
again. “You will all be sorry!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s not pay any attention to her any more!” said the
Soft-Voiced Cow. “She is very disagreeable and has delayed
us long enough as it is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Woman could run very fast and she soon
disappeared around the bend in the road. They heard her
clapping and shouting. When the travelers reached the bend
in the road a strange sight met their eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>As far as they could see before them and to either side was
a great bog.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa went up to it and pushed his cane into the edge.
It was very soft.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“We shall have to walk around it,” Gran’pa said, “for we
should sink out of sight if we attempted to cross it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Gran’pa wiped his cane off in the grass, he felt that
it was very sticky, and touching his finger to the bog he tasted
it. “Molasses candy mud!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is very unfortunate!” said the Princess as she looked
about. “We shall lose a lot of time walking around the
molasses candy bog!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I told you that you would be sorry!” cried a voice behind
them, and looking around they saw the Old Woman standing
on a little hill shaking her fist at them. “I made it with my
magic!” she called, “and you will never get across it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The unreasonable wicked creature!” Gran’ma cried as
she started after the Old Woman. “I will tweek your nose
for you if I catch you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Woman did not tarry long, but struck out over
the hill with Gran’ma close behind her. Gran’ma ran after
the Old Woman and the others followed. The Old Woman
made for a little house not far away and as she jumped
through the door, she, the house and all disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well!” Gran’pa cried as he came up to Gran’ma. “We
are rid of her at any rate!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope we shall never see her again,” said the Soft-Voiced
Cow. “Like most disagreeable people she isn’t satisfied unless
everyone else is uncomfortable, depressed and so unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We may as well start walking around the molasses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>candy bog,” said the Princess, “for we are losing so much time
old Jingles may catch up with us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have a suggestion,” said the Soft-Voiced Cow, “which
may be helpful. Let us all walk down to the molasses candy
bog, and when we are at the edge I will take you all on my
back and carry you some distance along the bank, so that you
will not leave any footprints. Then when the Magician
comes along he will not be able to track you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is an excellent idea!” said Gran’pa. “Let us act
upon the Soft-Voiced Cow’s suggestion!” So they all walked
down to the molasses candy bog.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soft-Voiced Cow took Gran’ma, Janey and the
Princess upon her back and carried them far down the bank;
then she returned and carried Gran’pa and Johnny to where
the others were waiting.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as they walked the bank gradually curved in until in
a short time they were walking in the direction from which
they had just come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This will never do,” said Gran’pa coming to a stop, “for
we are returning from whence we came.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And when they walked back along the bank the same thing
happened. Everything went swinging before them in long,
sweeping circles. They couldn’t make heads or tails of the
shore line.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us try walking away from the molasses candy bog,”
said Johnny, “and see what happens then!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>So they turned their backs to the bog and started walking
away from it. Sure enough, when they did this the bog began
to fade away, and soon it disappeared entirely!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whee!” cried the children. “We can go ahead!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The travelers had lost a lot of valuable time, so they
hastened across the fields where the bog had been.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see!” said the Princess, “Johnny was right! The
Old Woman’s magic was as contrary as herself, for when the
molasses candy bog thought we did not care whether we
crossed it or not, it disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the travelers walked along, they saw numbers of small
animals running about.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder where these little animals were when the great
molasses bog was here!” Janey
said looking at them curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll ask one of them,”
said the Soft-Voiced Cow,
and she talked to the strange
little beast in animal talk.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_099.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>When the little animal answered, the Soft-Voiced Cow
rolled over on the ground with laughter and when at last she
could speak she said, “I asked the animal where it was when
the bog was here, and it said there never had been a bog here.
Said it had lived here for years and the ground had always
been as it is now, except after a hard rain, so you see the Old
Woman only made us believe we saw a bog here, when in
reality there was none at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s queer,” exclaimed Gran’pa, “but I certainly tasted
molasses candy on my cane! In fact,” he said, looking at the
cane, “there is still some on it now!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me taste it!” Gran’ma cried. “Yes,” she said, “it
is molasses candy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well at any rate we are not troubled with the bog now!”
Janey mused.</p>

<p class='c010'>Across the fields rose high mountains.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if we shall be able to find a path through the
mountains!” Gran’pa said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think those are the mountains bordering the City of
Nite!” said the Princess. “And if that is the case we have
not very much farther to travel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the mountains were farther away than the travelers
thought, for after walking for an hour they came to a rise in
the ground from which they looked across miles and miles of
beautiful valley country. Gran’ma and Gran’pa said it was
almost as pretty as the country round the farm back home.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Down in the valley a little way they saw a tiny house and
walked in that direction. When they came to the front gate
and called no one answered, so they walked in and knocked
at the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>As no one answered the knock they walked around to the
back door and looked inside the kitchen, for the door was
open. There on the stove were pots and pans filled with
food which was cooking; and as they watched, one of the pots
raised itself from the stove and poured its contents into
another pot. Then another pot moved across the stove and
its lid came off and hung itself in the air, while a large spoon
raised itself from the back of the stove and stirred the contents
of the pot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall we go in?” Janey whispered, as they all hesitated
on the step.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa raised his cane and knocked three times on the
door sill.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was that?” cried a man’s voice from the front part
of the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something hammered upon the door!” a woman’s voice
in the kitchen answered. “But I can see nothing outside to
cause the noise!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa raised his cane and gave three more knocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you ever!” the woman’s voice cried. “I was looking
right at the spot where the noise came from and I could not
see a thing!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Evidently the man had come to the kitchen door and stood
near the woman, for the travelers heard him speak right at the
back door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What could it have been, Ella?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa turned and winked at the others and again rapped
three times with his cane upon the door sill.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There! You hear for yourself, Jules! There must be
an invisible person knocking at the door!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is anyone there?” asked the man’s voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are standing right here in plain sight!” Gran’ma
replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me!” the woman’s voice said. “I can see no one,
can you, Jules?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t see anyone!” Jules answered. “Whoever it is
must be invisible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the Princess of Nite, Janey and Johnny, Gran’ma
and Gran’pa Huggins!” Gran’pa said. “We can see ourselves
easily, but you are invisible to us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had we better ask them in?” Ella inquired of the man.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_102.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, do come in!” he said in answer, and as Gran’pa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>was nearest the door, he walked in first and bumped right into
the Invisible Man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please excuse me!” Gran’pa said. “I am sorry, but I
did not see you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right,” the Invisible Man replied in a cheery
voice. “I was standing right in the doorway and I should
have moved out of your way!”</p>

<p class='c010'>His voice now came from the other side of the kitchen.
“We will stand over at this side of the room until all of you
have gone into the dining room. We were about to have
dinner, and if you will take pot luck we shall be pleased to have
you dine with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is nice of you!” Gran’ma said as she and the
others walked into the dining room and sat down at the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is strange to hear people speak and not be able to see
them!” said Janey.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_103.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Johnny felt something brush against his leg and when he
felt down there he touched fur. “Here’s a kitten!” he cried,
as he picked it up and held it upon his lap. All could hear
the kitten purring as Johnny stroked its back, but it was
invisible too.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were only two plates upon the table when the visitors
entered the dining room, but now five more plates seemed
to place themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everybody pull up chairs!” said the Invisible Man, as
he caught hold of Gran’ma’s chair and tried to pull it towards
the table. “Please excuse me,” he laughed when he felt the
weight and knew that one of his guests was in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>All pulled their chairs up to the table, Ella suggesting that
the visitors be seated first so that she and Jules would know
just where they were.</p>

<p class='c010'>So all of the party presently were seated at the table and
Ella brought in the food from the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was strange for Gran’pa, Gran’ma, the children and the
Princess to see the dishes of food come floating in from the
kitchen, and it seemed as strange for Jules and Ella to hear
the voices of invisible guests and see their knives and forks
rise from the table to cut their food.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Jules had passed everything and all had helped themselves
he asked where they were traveling and where they had
come from.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a long story,” Gran’pa said.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Then Gran’ma told him of how they had come to the Moon,
and why they were traveling to the City of Nite.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the wicked Magician will not be able to see you,”
said Jules, “for you are invisible!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“No,” Gran’ma answered, “we are visible to him, but the
chances are that he will not be able to see you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that is the case, and he should pass here we will do our
best to help you!” said Ella.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the visitors had finished their dinner they thanked
Jules and Ella and asked if they might be excused.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“We are anxious to get to the City of Nite so that we can
assist the Princess in regaining her throne, and try to get our
Flying Boat so that we can return to the Earth,” they explained.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Invisible Man and Woman said they understood the
visitors’ hurry, and told them to stop in to see them if they
passed that way again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then the Soft-Voiced Cow put her head in at the door
and asked if they were ready to start.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Invisible Man and Woman heard the Soft-Voiced
Cow speak they asked if they had forgotten to invite
some of the party in to dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the Soft-Voiced Cow,” explained the Princess. “She
has been eating her dinner of grass out in the back yard!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can scarcely believe there is a Cow there!” said the
voice of Ella. “Would the Cow mind if I touched her to see
if I can feel her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soft-Voiced Cow laughed heartily at this and stood
still while Ella patted her.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a lot of reaching around in the air, Gran’pa and the
rest succeeded in shaking hands with their invisible friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Funny how pleasant people keep out of sight,” Gran’ma
said as her party started down the walk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you so much!” they all cried. “We hope to see
you again some time!”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this the Invisible Man and Woman laughed and replied,
“And we hope to see you again some time, too!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Tiptoe, the Dancing Master, Uses His Magic Umbrella</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>After traveling for a long time the travelers finally
came to the mountains and as they walked up a path
amongst the rocks they heard someone talking.</p>

<p class='c010'>It proved to be a queer little man, no larger than Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was seated near a large stone in the shade of a small
umbrella, and he was talking to himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he heard the footsteps of the party, he arose to his
feet and made a low bow, sweeping the dust from the ground
with the top of his high hat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good afternoon!” he called cheerily.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Then seeing the Princess, who had been walking behind
Gran’pa, he rushed towards her and threw himself at her feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s my old Dancing Master, Tiptoe!” cried the Princess
as she pulled the little man to his feet and gave him a hug
before introducing him to Gran’pa and the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doing way out here in the mountains?” the
Princess asked when they had all taken seats around the Dancing
Master.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dancing Master took out a red handkerchief and
wiped his nose-glasses carefully. “It’s really a long story,”
he replied. “Won’t you tell me where you have been for
eighty years first?” he inquired of the Princess.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess told him of her strange adventure with the
Queer Horse and all that had happened up to the time she
was rescued from the Green Jar by Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she had finished her story the Dancing Master took
Gran’ma’s hand and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everyone in the City of Nite owes you a debt of gratitude,
Gran’ma,” he said, “and in some manner or other I,
for one, hope to repay you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh it wasn’t anything!” Gran’ma cried. “I just saw
the Green Jar and opened it because I was inquisitive. Of
course we are very glad that we rescued the Princess from the
Green Jar but we do not deserve any credit for it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey, who was anxious to hear the Dancing Master’s story,
again asked Tiptoe how he happened to be in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“The day you disappeared,” the Dancing Master said,
turning to the Princess, “I was to have given you a lesson,
don’t you remember? And I was on my way to the Castle
when I saw people running in all directions about the City of
Nite. I inquired of one why they were so excited. ‘Don’t you
know?’ he answered. ‘The Beautiful Princess has disappeared!
Completely vanished!’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I heard this I ran with all speed to the Castle. I
had the right to enter at any time in the day,” he explained to
the children, “so I ran right up to the ball-room, for I heard
voices in loud discord coming from there!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There I found a strange looking woman, with long
straggly hair and a long nose, shaking her walking stick at the
Princess’ Ladies in Waiting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is going on here?” I cried as I ran up to the group
of ladies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘This strange creature claims to be the Princess and says
that a Magician has transformed her into an old woman,’ the
Ladies in Waiting answered. ‘We do not believe she is
telling us the truth!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I could not believe it myself,” added the Dancing
Master, “but still I have heard of stranger things, so I said
to the Ladies in Waiting, ‘Perhaps she really is the Princess!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“At first I could not get any of the ladies to agree with
me,” the Little Man went on, “and really, to tell the truth, I
could not blame them much for as the days went by the queer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>creature who said she had been changed from our own Beautiful
Princess into this ugly woman did such disagreeable
things to the Ladies in Waiting they all moved from the Castle,
and would not have anything to do with her. After a while
I discovered that the old woman was not the Princess.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must know that by this time no one ever went near
the old woman, who lived alone and kept herself shut up in a
room away in the top of the Castle tower. One night, as I was
passing the Castle, I heard a window creak far above my head,
and looking up I saw the old woman, seated in an umbrella,
fly out of the tower window and go speeding away out of
sight. Then I knew that she was a witch!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ran home as fast as I could and told Mrs. Tiptoe what
I had seen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We were so excited at first we couldn’t think of a thing to
say. We just looked at each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Tiptoe was one of the Ladies in Waiting to the
Princess!” the Dancing Master explained to Gran’ma.
“Finally my good wife cried, ‘I knew it all along! It is not
our beautiful Princess. Who knows but that this wicked
Witch has taken the Princess and hidden her away somewhere!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I will go see this Witch and talk to her myself!’ Mrs.
Tiptoe cried an instant later and I could not dissuade her.
Although she might have known it would lead to trouble, she
put on her bonnet and ran to the Castle!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Of course I followed. We went up the palace steps
together and right in at the door. The Palace was a sight!”
exclaimed the Little Man. “No one ever went there and there
were papers and cobwebs all over the place. No one cleaned
any of the rooms, for no one would have anything to do with
that disagreeable old creature! So we went through the Palace
until we came to the rooms the old hag used for her living
quarters, and there we found proof that it indeed was not our
beloved Princess!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the poor Dancing Master fell to weeping so violently
the Princess came and placed her arm over his shoulder,
and Gran’pa and Gran’ma looked far across the valley, their
eyes swimming in tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Dancing Master had dried his eyes he continued,
“We found many charms and implements of magic. Rabbit’s
feet, and other things of the kind. Then, too, in corners and
upon shelves about the room were jars of peculiar powder with
labels which we could not read pasted upon them. In the
center of the room was an iron kettle and queer designs had
been traced about on the marble floor with black, green and
yellow paint.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I knew she was a witch!’ my wife cried. ‘Go call the
Guards while I wait here to see that she does not escape!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ran out of the castle in hopes that I might bring the
Guards and place them in the room before the old witch
returned. But try as hard as I could, I could not find a Guard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>anywhere; they had all gone to parties or were off on their
vacations, so I ran back to the castle. ‘We will capture the
Witch ourselves!’ I cried as I ran into the Witch’s room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I expected to see Mrs. Tiptoe sitting there with a stern
expression on her face, just waiting for the Witch’s return, but
what was my surprise and consternation to see the Witch herself
leering at me with her wicked smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Witch told me I was the only one who knew for sure
she was not the Princess, so she would send me in search of
Mrs. Tiptoe. ‘For,’ said the wicked creature, ‘by the time
you find your wife, you will have learned better than to tell
anyone that I am not the Princess!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And,” continued the Dancing Master, “without saying
another word she opened her Magic Umbrella and pointed her
crooked cane at me. I was forced to step into the Magic
Umbrella. As I did so it shot out of the window so fast I could
scarcely catch my breath. Over the town of Nite I flew and
over the mountains I soared, until finally the Magic Umbrella
lit upon the ground miles and miles away from everybody. It
was days and days before I met anyone to talk to—awfully
lonely life, but since then I have heard from people in different
towns that the wicked creature still rules the City of Nite!” the
Dancing Master finished, “but I have never ventured back
there since she made me fly from the place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And how long is it since you left the City of Nite?”
Gran’ma inquired.</p>

<p>“I was forced to step into the Magic Umbrella.” (page <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The Dancing Master looked at the handle of his umbrella.
“I have put a notch on the handle for each year,” he replied,
and when he had counted them he said “Seventy-six years!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you have never been able to find your wife?” asked
Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dancing Master shook his head sadly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we ever get to the City of Nite I will tweek the nose
of that wicked Witch!” cried Gran’ma, as she snapped her
fingers in the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And if I have a good chance,” said the Soft-Voiced Cow,
who had wandered up and had listened to the Dancing Master’s
story, “I will raise my heels and upset her!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know what to suggest,” said the Dancing Master.
“Perhaps it would be best if we do not return to the City of
Nite, for the wicked creature may work harm to us all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>I</i> shall return to the City of Nite,” said the Princess, as
she stamped her foot, “for it is my throne and I will have it
back!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I will go with you,” Gran’pa cried, “and help you
regain your throne!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll all go!” Gran’ma cried, jumping to her feet and
smoothing out her apron.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a long hard road!” said the Dancing Master doubtfully.
“Why not live here in the mountains where we shall
not be troubled, for I myself have lived here for the last ten
years and it is very agreeable!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>They followed the Dancing Master as he led the way up
over the rocks until they came to a level place, at the back of
which was a Cave.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dancing Master, with timber which he had hewn from
the trees, had made the front part of a tiny Cottage, with a
wide piazza to fit the opening of the Cave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This has been my home for ten years!” he said, “and the
absence of Mrs. Tiptoe from it is all that keeps my happiness
from being complete!”</p>

<p class='c010'>When all had entered the little Cottage-Cave, the Dancing
Master set the table and with Gran’ma’s help made tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>When all were seated about the room (with the exception
of the Soft-Voiced Cow, who was too large to enter the tiny
doorway) the Princess said to Mr. Tiptoe, “Tell me of my
father and mother. What did they think when they heard that
I had changed into a wicked looking Witch?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your dear mother, the Queen, came to the City of Nite
at once,” the Dancing Master answered, “but the Witch who
pretended to be you would not see her, saying that it would
not do to see her mother as she was too ugly; so your mother
returned without seeing the wicked creature at all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure your Mamma would have known it was not
you!” said Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>During all this time Johnny had been very thoughtful.
Presently he asked, “When you traveled in the Magic
Umbrella, how did you guide it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“The first time I rode in it,” the Dancing Master answered,
“I did not guide it. I came down without any thought of
where I was going, but as there was not a thing near by, I
stepped back into the Magic Umbrella and wished it would
fly to a town, and sure enough it flew there! All you have to
do,” he continued, “is to sit in it and wish it to go somewhere!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” said Johnny, “I have a suggestion! Let us all
sit in the umbrella and wish it to take us to the City of Nite!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a fine idea!” cried the Princess, clapping her hands.
“Let us go there immediately!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dancing Master carried the Magic Umbrella out upon
the level place in front of the Cottage-Cave. Then he stood and
scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can we all get into it?” he wondered.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was scarcely large enough for them all, even if they sat
upon the edges, and while they were all squeezing into the
Magic Umbrella the Soft-Voiced Cow walked up.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_117.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“What about the Soft-Voiced Cow!” cried Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not leave her behind if we never get to the City of
Nite, and if we never get back our Flying Boat!” cried
Gran’ma, as she scrambled out of the Magic Umbrella.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor I either!” Gran’pa exclaimed as he too hopped from
the Magic Umbrella.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny and Janey followed them, and they all went over
to the Soft-Voiced Cow and sat down on the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may spoil everything!” said the Soft-Voiced Cow.
“Please do not think of me! Get into the umbrella and go
with the Princess to the City of Nite and I will follow as best
I can!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shan’t do it!” said Gran’ma firmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wouldn’t think of it!” cried Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have it!” cried the Dancing Master. “I hate to leave
the Soft-Voiced Cow here, so if the Princess will excuse me, I
will journey afoot with you and she can wish herself in the
City of Nite!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe it would be best for the Princess to wish herself
with her Mamma!” said Janey. “Then her Mamma and
Daddy can advise her what to do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your advice is good,” said the Princess, and kissing them
all good-bye, she stepped into the Magic Umbrella and flew
up over the mountains leaving the little group of friends watching
her with tear-dimmed eyes. She was such a good, dear,
sweet, beautiful Princess that they hated to see her go.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“I have a few things to pack,” said the Dancing Master,
“but I shall soon catch up with you. Keep to the right on all
paths up over the mountain and I shall soon be along!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny took the lead, then came Gran’ma, Janey and
Gran’pa. Up, up they toiled; up so high they could look back
and see the valley stretched far below them like a picture map.</p>

<p class='c010'>At one place they came to a waterfall which dashed straight
out of the solid rock and fell for hundreds of feet in a roar of
snow-white water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trees about the side of the river had soft green foliage,
different from any trees they had ever seen before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently, as they had traveled far and the climb had been
very steep, they decided it would be well to rest and wait for
the Dancing Master to catch up with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m getting hungry!” Gran’ma said, “I didn’t eat much
at the Dancing Master’s house!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I had a mince pie in my pocket!” said Gran’pa,
winking slyly at Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny walked over to where the river ran smoothly before
it again plunged down the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come here!” he cried excitedly. “Look at the strange
fish!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa, Janey and Gran’ma came running to the edge of
the stream, but the Soft-Voiced Cow continued eating the velvety
grass where she had first stopped. It was the most delicious
grass she had tasted in a long, long time.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Perhaps we can catch some,” said Gran’ma, “and fry them
for our supper!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny felt through his pockets. “I had a fishing line in
one of my pockets!” he said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_120.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“You used the line on the Flying Machine!” said Janey.
“Oh, isn’t that too bad!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here’s the hook!” said Johnny, as he turned his pocket
wrong side out and showed them the hook fastened in the cloth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa took his pocket knife and cut the hook out of
Johnny’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have some string,” Gran’pa said. “I know it always
comes in handy, so I put a lot in my pocket before Gran’ma
and I started up here!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Gran’pa cut a pole and fixed the line while Johnny found
a few worms under a stone.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the first cast of the line into the water Gran’pa pulled
out a lovely fish. It had a blue head. The body was white,
with a round yellow spot on each side.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa caught three more like the first and then six brown
fish, round and flat with one side of them a golden yellow.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Johnny and Gran’pa were building the fire and
cutting sticks to broil the fish on, Janey found some worms and
caught five queer fish with holes right through them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aren’t they queer?” she cried as she put her fingers
through the holes and carried them over to Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma caught four very fat fish which looked more like
balls than fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe these are good to eat,” she said as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>brought them over to the fire. “They feel so light and empty
and puffy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa and Johnny had by this time fixed the first fish
upon the sticks and they were beginning to broil.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma sniffed the air. “Smells like they might be good,
but they don’t smell like fish!” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the fish were done, Gran’pa and Johnny turned
them over on a clean white stone. “Eggs!” Johnny shouted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indeed the first fish were nothing more nor less than ordinary
eggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other brown fish, one side of which was golden yellow,
turned out to be brown bread and butter when it was broiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey’s fish turned out to be doughnuts, and Gran’ma’s
changed to cream puffs when placed before the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is fit for a king!” Gran’ma cried as she sampled the
egg fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder why Mr. Tiptoe doesn’t come,” Gran’pa said.
“He must have packed up quite a load! Guess I’ll run down
the mountain and help him along!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed you won’t!” cried Gran’ma as she caught his coat
tails.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t know when old Jingles the Magician may
catch up with us! I think now that we have finished our dinners,
it would be best if we hurried on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, let’s go on!” Johnny suggested. “Mr. Tiptoe knows
the way and will soon catch up with us!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Johnny and Janey Grow Very Tall and Have Some Strange Adventures</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The path led up over a ledge in the mountain, revealing
a pretty little valley between the high cliffs on either
side. The grass under their feet was soft as velvet as
they walked toward a tiny white bridge over a brook.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This ought to be good ground for growing potatoes!”
said Gran’pa, stopping to gaze about him at the charming
valley.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma was ahead and had started across the little bridge
when the rest saw her trip and almost fall. She managed to
save herself by catching the railing, and the others, as they ran
toward her, heard a bell tinkling up one side of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some mean person stretched a wire across the bridge and I
tripped over it!” Gran’ma cried, as she showed the others the
offending wire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny caught hold of it to pull it loose, but gave a whoop
and started jumping up and down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The bell up the cliff tinkled each time Johnny jumped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey, wishing to help her brother, caught Johnny’s hands
to pull them from the tiny wire, and with a cry she too began
hopping up and down and shouting for help.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Gran’ma reached for Janey, Gran’pa pushed her aside.
“Don’t touch them!” he yelled. “It’s an electric wire! Stand
back!” And with this Gran’pa took the crooked handle of his
cane and jerked the wire from Johnny’s hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny and Janey sat down with a bump upon the tiny
bridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“O—oh Brud,” Janey laughed. “Wasn’t that funny!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s funny, now,” answered her brother, “but it wasn’t
pleasant when I first touched the wire! It felt as if I was being
stretched out about six feet tall!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You <i>are</i> getting longer!” Gran’ma cried, as she helped
Johnny to his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look at Janey!” he laughed. “Her dress is getting too
short for her! Ha! Ha!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see anything funny about it!” Gran’pa said reprovingly.
“In fact, it may be very serious!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny sobered up and twisted about to see himself. Both
Johnny and Janey had grown two feet taller and were still
growing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their clothes were far too short to cover them and they
looked ridiculous. Janey began crying as the Soft-Voiced Cow
caught up with them.</p>

<div id='Soft'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_125.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>The -Voiced Cow jumped three feet in the air and started across the valley kicking her heels and mooing. (page <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Whatever in the world has happened?” she asked as she
sat down upon the wire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa cried “LOOK OUT!” but he was too late. The
Soft-Voiced Cow jumped three feet in the air and started across
the valley, kicking her heels and mooing, while the tiny wire
wrapped itself about her tail.</p>

<p class='c010'>With Gran’pa in the lead, waving his cane, they all ran
after the Soft-Voiced Cow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait a minute!” Gran’pa shouted. “I’ll pull it off with
my cane! WAIT A MINUTE!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Soft-Voiced Cow continued running until the wire
became tangled in a bush and was pulled from her tail.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she was free the Soft-Voiced Cow rolled head over
heels and turned a complete somersault before she sat up and
looked around wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do believe I lost my cud!” she exclaimed as Gran’pa
and the children came up to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your cud!” Janey exclaimed in wonderment.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_127.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my chewing gum!” replied the Soft-Voiced Cow.
“All cows have cuds for chewing gum.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you left it at
the Little Man’s house!”
Janey suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! The Soft-Voiced
Cow wasn’t in the house!” Gran’ma said, as she joined the
group.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Look in all your pockets!” Johnny suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe you swallowed it,” Gran’pa remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, maybe I did!” the Soft-Voiced Cow replied. “Sometimes
I do when I’m excited! Yes, here it is!” and with a contented
sigh the Soft-Voiced Cow began chewing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny and Janey had stopped growing by this time and
it was well they had, for their clothes were now so tight they
were very uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, everyone keep away from the wire!” Gran’pa
advised, pointing to it with his stick. “Let us get away from
here as fast as we can and watch our steps from now on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s funny the Soft-Voiced Cow doesn’t grow taller!”
Johnny said to Janey as they followed the others across the
valley. “She hasn’t grown a bit!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad she hasn’t,” Janey replied, “for it certainly is
uncomfortable to be so tall!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey was a head taller than Gran’ma, and Johnny was
still taller than she was. Their stockings came nowhere near
their knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought I heard a bell tinkling when we touched the
wire!” Gran’ma said as they walked along.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So did I,” the Soft-Voiced Cow laughed. “When I did
not have the wire fastened about my tail!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the travelers came around the bend of the mountain and
left the little valley, they saw before them a little hut such as
one sees at fair-grounds and pleasure resorts.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>A queer little man wearing a stove pipe hat leaned over the
counter at the front of the hut and smiled at them. “Was it
you who rang the bell?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess all of us rang it!” Gran’ma replied, for she saw
the little man was going to be agreeable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little man turned and looked at the dial at the side of
the hut; the indicator pointed to four.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You rang the bell four times,” he said in a matter of fact
voice, “so you get four cigars!” and he handed out four large
black cigars.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t smoke!” said the Soft-Voiced Cow, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor I either!” Gran’ma. Janey and Johnny chimed in
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then this gentleman may have them!” said the man as
he handed the four fat cigars to Gran’pa. “Someone has to
have them, you know,” he said, “for each time the bell rings
I have to give someone a cigar!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa put the cigars in his pocket. “I’ll smoke them
after a while!” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they’ll melt!” cried the man. “You must eat them
right away!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa pulled the cigars from his pocket, then with a
smile he handed one to each of the children and to Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cigars were made of chocolate candy. “Won’t you
have one?” Gran’pa asked, offering the remaining cigar to the
Soft-Voiced Cow.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“No, thanks,” the Soft-Voiced Cow replied, “I hardly ever
eat candy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have some nice buttered popcorn!” the man suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I might have a basket of popcorn, if you have it to spare!”
the Soft-Voiced Cow laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shall have it!” the man replied, as he reached behind
the counter and lifted a basket of popcorn to the Soft-Voiced
Cow.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soft-Voiced Cow took one mouthful of the popcorn
and then blew it out of her mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It has mustard on it!” the Soft-Voiced Cow said, as the
tears streamed out of her eyes and she sneezed two or three
times.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mustard!” the man at the counter exclaimed, looking at
the cow with a queer expression. “Of course it has mustard
on it! I put it on to keep the popcorn hot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa winked at Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you any ice cream cones?” Janey asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Plenty!” the man replied. “What flavor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Strawberry!” Janey said. “Chocolate!” cried Johnny.
“Maple!” Gran’ma said. “Peach!” said Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me! I haven’t any of those flavors! I never heard
of them!” And the man leaned upon the counter and
scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never heard of chocolate!” exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“What flavors have you?” asked Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have Plumpdoodle, Wiggledoos, Kneebud and Lopjiggle!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me try a Lopjiggle!” said Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Plumpdoodle!” Gran’ma decided.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wiggledoos!” cried Johnny. “They must be fine!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I will have a Kneebud!” said Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man handed out the different ice cream cones, and
although the flavor of each was different from anything they
had ever tasted the travelers thought them fine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then the little bell up on the side of the cliff began
tinkling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello!” said the man. “Someone else gets a cigar!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They all ran to where they could look down into the little
valley and there they saw old Jingles, the wicked Magician,
holding on to the electric wire and turning flip-flops in his
efforts to get free.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soft-Voiced Cow began switching her tail nervously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s Old Jingles, the Magician!” cried all in one voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been in hopes I should land him on the wire!”
said the man. “Do you know,” he explained in a confidential
tone, “that is the reason I started this place in the mountains!
Here, Gran’pa,” he continued, “you may have his cigar. All
of you help yourselves to anything you wish. I am through
with the business now that old Jingles is on the wire!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you intend doing?” asked Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“Nothing,” answered the man. “I’m through now, and
I’m going back to the City of Nite!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The bell kept on tinkling and the indicator on the dial kept
whirling around in a circle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take all the cigars you wish!” the man called to Johnny
and Janey, who were behind the counter. “He’s ringing up
quite a lot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad your wire stopped the wicked creature,” said
Gran’ma, “for he was after us and would soon have overtaken
us. He took the children’s Flying Machine and he took
Gran’pa’s Flying Boat, and he is the one who put the Princess
of Nite into the Green Jar!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Put the lovely Princess in the Green Jar!” the man
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes!” Gran’pa answered, as they stood and watched the
antics of the Magician. “And Gran’ma rescued her! The
Princess is on her way to the City of Nite now, in the Dancing
Master’s Umbrella!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Not Tiptoe’s Magic Umbrella?” the man asked, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Gran’pa. “His name is Tiptoe and he
was the Princess’ Dancing Master.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And my brother!” said the Little Man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sh!” he added in a whisper, as he glanced hastily about
as if to see that no others were listening. “It’s a secret! I was
the Chief of Detectives in the City of Nite when the Princess
disappeared, and I had to leave when I found out that the
wicked creature who claimed to be the Princess really was a
Witch! She made it so unpleasant for me that I decided to
go in search of Old Jingles the Magician, to see if he would
help me find the real Princess. Excuse me a moment,” and he
went back of the counter where the children were eating the
strange ice creams with large spoons.</p>

<p class='c010'>Opening a box with a key which he wore on his watch chain,
he studied the figures on a number of dials; then when he had
written the figures upon a piece of paper, he handed it to
Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you add?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny ran his eyes over the figures. “Nine hundred and
fifty-eight!” he said, as he returned the paper to the Chief of
Detectives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not half enough!” said the Chief of Detectives, as he
pulled six little levers. There was a steady buzz-buzz that
grew louder and louder every minute.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Johnny watched the hands on the dials climb and climb.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fifteen hundred and ninety-eight!” he cried out, presently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s better!” said the Chief of Detectives. “Give the
Soft-Voiced Cow some of that popcorn in the green box; it has
no mustard on it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s hopping to beat the band!” Gran’ma cried delightedly,
as the Chief of Detectives came up to where they were
watching the Magician.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think he would!” said the man. “I turned on
the current twice as hard!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then they saw the Dancing Master coming over the
hill into the valley.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here he comes now!” cried Gran’pa. “It’s your brother,
Tiptoe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All stay here!” cried the Chief of Detectives. “Don’t
move from this spot!” And with this he set off at a good speed
across the valley to meet his brother.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Tiptoe Brothers and the Slide Raft</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Gran’ma and Gran’pa saw the Tiptoe Brothers throw
their arms around each other’s necks in their joy at
meeting, but they walked in a wide circle around the
spot where Jingles the Magician was dancing in his efforts to
free himself from the wire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should have been sooner,” said the Dancing Master to
Gran’pa and Gran’ma, “but just as I started to leave the Cottage-Cave
I saw a Flying Boat coming across the country, and
I knew from your story that the wicked Jingles must be in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did he do?” asked the children.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He left his Flying Boat out in front of the Cottage-Cave
and came inside, and while he was snooping around I slipped
out the back way, went round the Cottage-Cave, and touched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>a match to his Flying Boat! He will have to walk from now
on!” And the Dancing Master did a graceful little dance
step and snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh dear!” Gran’ma cried as she sat down hard upon the
grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whatever is the matter?” the Tiptoe Brothers cried, as
Gran’pa helped Gran’ma to her feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was our Flying Boat!” replied Gran’pa quietly, “and
the only way we had of ever getting back home to the Earth!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dancing Master was crestfallen. “I am always putting
my foot into it!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please do not worry,” said Gran’ma, seeing how sorry the
Dancing Master felt. “You did just what you thought was
best!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed I did!” answered the Dancing Master. “But
that does not bring back the Flying Boat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you intend doing with the wicked Magician?”
asked Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing!” replied the Chief of Detectives. “He is very
well off where he is, and he will never be able to do any mischief
as long as he holds on to the wire, or,” he added with a sly wink
at the Soft-Voiced Cow, “until the wire lets go of him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel sorry for him!” said Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well you need not, Sis!” Johnny cried. “Look at me
and you will see about how you look! And it is all the wicked
Jingles’ fault!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Why, what in the world is the matter?” asked the Dancing
Master, noticing for the first time that Janey and Johnny
had grown so much taller.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We caught hold of the wire!” replied Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And it made you grow so much taller?” cried the Dancing
Master in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have they grown taller?” asked the Chief of Detectives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly!” the Dancing Master answered. “They were
only children and were no taller than myself when they left
me three hours ago!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without saying a word, the Chief of Detectives motioned
to the children and the others to follow him, and going to the
counter he took a small case from under the counter, and from
it a tiny bellows.</p>

<p class='c010'>He then blew a puff of powder over the children and in a
short time they had resumed their normal size.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, putting the case in his pocket, the Chief of Detectives
said it would be best for them to try and reach the City
of Nite as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall have the old Witch to contend with when we
reach there,” he reminded the others, “and perhaps even now
the Princess is under the power of the wicked creature!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us hasten!” cried Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>The road now led down the mountain side. A short distance
from the Chief of Detectives’ hut it wound through a
deep forest, which made the traveling cool and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>At last they came to a section of the forest where all the
trees were of pine. Here there was a thick carpet of pine
needles that had dropped from the boughs for years.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were smooth, soft and slippery.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s get a board and slide down the mountain on the pine
needles!” said Gran’pa, noticing that there was a clear space
beneath the trees, which slanted straight down the mountain
side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are no boards about!” said Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll run back to the hut up the mountain and get some!”
the Chief of Detectives volunteered, and away he started.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait there for me!” he called as he disappeared up the
path.</p>

<p class='c010'>The party sat down to wait the return of the Chief of
Detectives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was funny the electric wire did not affect the Soft-Voiced
Cow!” mused Johnny. “It surely made Janey and me
grow like weeds!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll ask my brother about it when he returns!” replied the
Dancing Master.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not long before they heard the Chief of Detectives
singing a yodel song, and soon he came into view over the
rocks, carrying a pile of boards, a hammer, some nails and a
long piece of rope.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Gran’pa was an expert carpenter he offered to fix the
sliding boards.</p>

<div id='Down'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_140.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>Down, down, the Slide Raft sped, until it was going so fast that its occupants could not talk. (page <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Let’s build one big sled!” he suggested, “and then we can
all be together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A good idea!” agreed the Tiptoe Brothers.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Gran’pa hammered the boards together and tied them in
such a manner that soon he had a fine looking Slide Raft.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We should have a rudder to guide it with,” Gran’pa said
as he stood and studied his work, “for who knows but that the
mountain may take a few sudden turns farther down!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Gran’pa with his jack knife sawed away at a small tree
until he had cut it down, and with the help of the rope and
some small pieces of boards he made a rudder.</p>

<p class='c010'>They all sat down on the Slide Raft, and with everybody
pushing and shoving the Slide Raft started down the mountain
side, gaining momentum as it went over the slippery needles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soft-Voiced Cow sat in the center of the Slide Raft
and the others about her. Gran’pa stood at the rudder to guide
the Slide Raft should they come to a sudden turn.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was well that Gran’pa had thought of the rudder, for
when they had slid down the mountain for about a mile, and
the Slide Raft was speeding along at a terrific pace, they came
to where the open space beneath the trees turned sharply to the
right.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa swung the rudder round as hard as he could and
turned the Slide Raft just in time to escape the trees at the
side.</p>

<p class='c010'>Down, down, the Slide Raft sped, until it was going so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>fast that its occupants could not talk. The wind whistled past
them like a gale, and if it had not been for the weight of the
Soft-Voiced Cow they would have been swept from the Slide
Raft by the force of the wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as they were nearing the bottom of the mountain the
ground took a dip. Down this the frail Slide Raft shot suddenly,
and up the other side.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma and Janey screamed as the Slide Raft left the
ground at the top of the little mound and plunged straight
down for a hundred feet or more.</p>

<p class='c010'>As good fortune had it, the path of the Slide Raft seemed
to have been made for just such tobogganing. At the bottom
of the fearful drop the ground fell away in a graceful curve,
so, after hitting the ground at the bottom of the mountain, the
Slide Raft went about five hundred feet out across a small
pond at the edge of the pine forest, skipping across the water
like a skipper rock thrown by a boy, and came to rest a short
distance from the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the Slide Raft stopped, the Soft-Voiced Cow fell over
on her side and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa jumped from the raft and pulled it into shore,
while the Tiptoe Brothers filled their hats with water which
they dashed over the head of the Soft-Voiced Cow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has fainted!” Gran’ma said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s get her ashore!” Johnny cried. “Everybody take
hold!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>It took a lot of pulling and tugging, but finally they got
the Soft-Voiced Cow up the bank and pulled grass for a pillow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I had my smelling salts!” cried Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>The water did not seem to help the Soft-Voiced Cow, and
she rolled her eyes in an alarming manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She may start kicking any minute!” Gran’pa warned.
“Don’t get too close to her heels! I had a cow that acted the
same way once!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sure enough, the Soft-Voiced Cow did begin kicking, and
as they drew away from her she turned her head towards
Gran’ma with a pathetic look in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m going to hold her head!” cried Gran’ma, forgetting
in her anxiety that her friend was only a Cow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma’s soft hand smoothed the Soft-Voiced Cow’s forehead,
and the Cow, seeming to feel Gran’ma’s affection, placed
one of her front feet on Gran’ma’s lap. Gran’ma sat holding
the Cow’s foot and smoothing her brow, meanwhile talking to
her in a gentle, soothing manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>The others, who stood by watching, had to brush the tears
from their eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not puff your magic powder on her?” Janey cried
to the Chief of Detectives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will only cure magic!” cried that good little man as he
took the tiny bellows from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny jumped forward and blew a generous puff upon
the Soft-Voiced Cow’s head.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The Soft-Voiced Cow seemed to shrink in size and turned
a different color.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Mister! You <i>HAVE</i> done it!” Janey cried as she
stamped her foot at Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny stood as if frozen, watching the Soft-Voiced Cow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s got a HAND!” Gran’ma cried excitedly. “Two of
them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the others drew closer they saw that their friend, the
Soft-Voiced Cow, was turning into a woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tiptoe Brothers uttered glad cries, and the Dancing
Master threw his arms about the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My wife!” he cried as he kissed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s Jenny!” cried the Chief of Detectives, turning a
radiant face to Gran’pa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There! You see?” Johnny said, as he and Janey turned
their backs on the reunited pair. “If the magic wire could not
make the Soft-Voiced Cow grow taller it was because she
already had been magicked. So I remembered that the powder
cured magic, and there you are!</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_144.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Johnny, you’re a dear!”
Janey answered, as she gave
him a great hug. “You always
know just what to do,
all the time!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, shucks!” Johnny replied.
“I did it without much thinking!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Well, you did it, anyway!” his sister insisted. “To think
she was a lady all this time and we did not know it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was a very ladylike Cow, at least!” said Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. and Mrs. Tiptoe came up to Johnny and Janey and
thanked them for what they had done.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was Johnny!” said Janey, generously, as the pretty
lady kissed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was Janey who suggested it!” said Johnny as he bashfully
received Mrs. Tiptoe’s reward.</p>

<p class='c010'>The happy little Dancing Master told his wife all that had
happened since the Princess and she had disappeared, and that
now the Princess was safe at home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At least, I hope she is,” he added. “She left us and flew
off for the City of Nite in the Magic Umbrella. Now tell us
of your strange adventure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is not much to tell,” Mrs. Tiptoe said, as the happy
party walked over the fields. “When you left me in the rooms
of the Witch she was hiding behind a door all the time, and
just as you left she pushed me into the Magic Umbrella and
jumped in with me. We flew out of the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you now know, it does not take the Magic Umbrella
long to get where you wish it to go, or at least it did not take
us long to get to where it settled to the ground. I could scarcely
stand when we got there. The wicked creature struck me with
her cane and said a strange rhyme, and I did not know a thing
until I awakened with my head in Gran’ma’s lap.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“How does it come that you are here, too?” she asked of
the Chief of Detectives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I started to tell Gran’ma and Gran’pa up on the mountain
a while ago,” he replied, “but I got off the subject. Now I
will tell the story, strange as it may seem.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here comes the Magic Umbrella!” cried Gran’ma, as she
pointed to a speck in the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the Princess!” cried the Detective. “No, it isn’t,
either,” he added as the Magic Umbrella drew closer.</p>

<p class='c010'>It proved to be the General of the Guard, and when he had
embraced the Tiptoe Brothers and Mrs. Tiptoe he was introduced
to the rest of the party.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Princess is quite safe!” he exclaimed, as all started
to ask after her, “and she has sent me to try and find you and
bring you to the Castle.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The General of the Guard took a knapsack from his back
and spread a large piece of silk upon the ground. Then
with heavy twine, he fastened the four corners of the
silk to the Magic Umbrella.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gran’ma, Janey and Mrs. Tiptoe, you ladies can ride in
the Magic Umbrella and we men will ride underneath,” he
directed. And when all had taken their places, the General
of the Guard told Gran’ma to wish the Magic Umbrella to fly
to the Princess’ Castle, and away they started.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City of Nite was built upon a beautiful island and in
the center stood the wonderful Castle, its tall spires and towers
rising high above all the other buildings.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they approached the Castle, the Magic Umbrella settled
upon one of the broad terraces. The Princess came running
out to meet them as the party climbed out of the Magic
Umbrella.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Tiptoe had to tell the Princess of her adventure as
they went inside the Castle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And to think you were the Soft-Voiced Cow,” laughed
the Princess, “and that none of us suspected it! My, I am glad
we are all safe and sound and home again!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“We are very glad too,” Gran’ma said, “but Gran’pa,
Janey, Johnny and I are still very far from home!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you will like it here,” the Princess laughed as she
threw her arms about Gran’ma. “And I shall have you live
here with me all the time in the Castle, for we owe everything
to you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You saved the Princess from the Green Jar and charmed
away the wicked magic from Mrs. Tiptoe!” exclaimed the
General of the Guard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must keep you with us always,” the Princess said
as the party walked into a great hall. “Now, Gran’pa,” she
continued, “I will let Mr. Tiptoe show you and Johnny to
your rooms, and when all have dressed we are going to have
a nice little party all to ourselves. I will take Gran’ma and
Janey and Mrs. Tiptoe to their rooms and we will meet you
in the Banquet Hall very soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess led Gran’ma, Janey and Mrs. Tiptoe to a
wonderful room with ivory and gold beds. Beautiful draperies
hung from the windows, and a merry little fountain tinkled
in one corner of the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here are your clothes,” the Princess said, opening a closet
and displaying rows and rows of wonderful silk and satin
dresses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey’s eyes were the size of saucers. Some of the dresses
were pink—and pink was her favorite color!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had them all made to fit you and Janey,” she told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Gran’ma. “I am so sorry I did not know that Mrs. Tiptoe was
to be with us, but she may have one of Janey’s dresses, I’m
sure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed she may!” Janey cried. “Oh, thank you so much,
Your Majesty!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, see here!” cried the Princess, pretending to be very
stern. “Do not ‘Your Majesty’ me! I am to be plain Nidia to
all of you, so you must begin to get used to calling me that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Princess, Mrs. Tiptoe, Gran’ma and Janey
reached the Banquet Hall, Gran’pa, Johnny and the Tiptoe
Brothers were there waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whee! How fine you all look!” Johnny cried, as he saw
the beautiful silk and satin dresses.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You look fine, too!” Janey exclaimed. “All of you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did the Princess know our measurements?” Johnny
whispered to Janey as they took their seats at the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know,” Janey replied, rather puzzled. “Just
see Gran’pa! My, doesn’t he look nice in that purple velvet!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are very anxious to know how you got rid of the
wicked Witch when you returned to the Castle,” Gran’ma said
to the Princess.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess laughed a merry laugh and replied, “I am
afraid you will be disappointed with my adventure, for when
I left you upon the mountain side at Mr. Tiptoe’s Cottage-Cave
I wished the Magic Umbrella to take me to my mother,
but as I flew over the City of Nite I changed my mind.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“‘No,’ I said to myself, ‘I will go right to the Castle and
face the wicked Witch!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And so I wished to go to the Castle instead of to my
mother. And when I climbed out of the Magic Umbrella I
ran right into the Castle and it was empty! I went through
all the rooms and found no one; the wicked Witch was not
there at all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you go into the little room at the top of the Blue
Tower?” Mr. Tiptoe asked. “That is where she was the day
Mrs. Tiptoe and I found her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I went there, too,” the Princess replied, “and cobwebs
were all over everything. I knew the wicked creature
had not been there for months.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For years, to be more exact,” interrupted the Chief of
Detectives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know?” the Princess asked the Chief of
Detectives in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Chief of Detectives explained.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I started to tell of my adventure to Gran’ma and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>others on the mountain side,” he said, “but I was so glad to
see my brother coming across the meadow I forgot what I was
saying.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell us now! Perhaps you can clear up the mystery!”
the Princess cried. “No one in the City of Nite could tell me
anything! Please tell us all you know, and all about your
adventure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you had not finished telling us of your own experience,”
the Chief of Detectives answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is very little more to tell,” said the Princess.
“When I discovered that the wicked Witch was not in the
Castle and that she had not been here for some time, I rang
the Great Bell five times. This, as you know, is the signal for
every one in the City of Nite to have a holiday. And when
the good people heard the Great Bell pealing, they came
running to the Castle and found me! That is all there is to
tell, except that every thing inside the Castle had grown dreadfully
musty, so I had everything cleaned, and new draperies
and then I sent the General of the Guard in the Magic
Umbrella to bring you here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Princess had finished the Chief of Detectives
told his story.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the Princess disappeared,” he began, “I was away
on my vacation and word did not reach me for four days. But
you may rest assured that when I did hear I hurried back to
the City of Nite as fast as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“I asked everyone I met about the strange disappearance
of the Princess, for I could not believe that the Princess had
been changed into an old woman. No one could help me.
People just stood around looking at one another as if they were
stunned. At first I thought it unwise to visit this old Witch
for fear she might find out that I distrusted her, but upon
second thought I changed my plans and went to see her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose I may tell our good friends of the secret
passage?” the Chief of Detectives interrupted himself to ask
the Princess, and being given permission he went on:</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are secret passages built in the walls of the Castle
which lead to many of the rooms, and by which anyone who
knows how to open the secret doors may escape. Now I, of
course, knew all the doors and all the buttons that open them,
so I went through all the secret passages and from their peepholes
I looked into all the rooms. But I could never time my
visits just right until about a year ago.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then one day as I walked through one of the secret
passages, I heard someone talking, so I hastily glued my eyes
to the peephole, you may be sure. But when I looked through,
I did not see the Witch in the room! Instead, there stood a
queer man with a tall hat and a crooked stick.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I could not quite make out what he was saying, for he
was only talking to himself and at times merely mumbled his
words, but I learned enough to know that he had no business
there.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Jingles the Magician!” cried the Princess, Gran’ma and
Janey in one breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right,” continued the Chief of Detectives. “I
heard him mutter something about a book of rhymes, and he
played with a queer little pouch with tassels!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Magic Whistle!” cried Gran’pa and Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know what it was,” said the Chief of Detectives.
“But as I watched the queer man he took off his tall hat and
coat and put them in a closet; then he took out a white wig
and a great cloak and bonnet and put them on. I saw then
that he and the Witch were one and the same and I knew
positively that neither was our beloved Princess. I did not
know what to do! At first I thought of calling the people
together and telling them of what I had seen, but then,
thought I, ‘Should I do that, I may never discover what has
become of the Princess.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I watched at the secret passage for days and days
until once again I was rewarded. There was the queer man
again, sitting and reading a large book and trying to memorize
some verses. Then I watched him until I saw him put on a
pair of spectacles. He stared for a moment for all the world
like a near-sighted person. Then he skipped up and down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Someone is drinking my lemonade,’ he cried, looking
through them. ‘Hooray! Now I will have someone else to
work my magic on!’ And with this, he jumped upon his large
book and flew right out of the window!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“It was Janey who drank at the lemonade spring!” cried
Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not know that, of course,” said the Chief of Detectives.
“However, when the wicked man left, I went into the
room and looked about. In the pocket of the cloak which
the Witch had worn, I discovered the tiny powder puff which
Johnny puffed upon the Soft-Voiced Cow, or upon Mrs. Tiptoe,
I should have said! I also found a tiny book of magic and
a few brass buttons and other charms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I took the powder puff, the tiny book of magic and the
charms; I also made a drawing of the queer designs upon the
floor. Then I left everything else just as I had found it and
went home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I studied the book of magic a long time before I finally
tested out some magic myself. First, I copied the designs upon
a large white rug then, following the directions in the little
book, I placed the charms about as directed, then I puffed a bit
of powder into a tin cup and touched a match to it. When
the powder puffed up into the room, I went out of the door as
fast as I could. But when I saw the room had cleared, I ventured
back and found written upon the slate—I forgot to mention
that one of the things called for in the book was a slate
and pencil—‘Top of Whippoorwill Mountain. Electric wires
strung meadow. Capture!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I puzzled and puzzled over this message, and I tried the
magic three times. The same message always came upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>slate! Then I decided to go to the top of Whippoorwill Mountain
and see the wires, but there were no wires there!</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Perhaps it means that I am to put the wires there,’ I
thought. ‘At least I can try it!’ So I had the Royal Electrician
fix up the wires about the meadow, and then I built the
little hut and filled it with ice cream and popcorn and cigars,
so that if I accidentally caught any innocent persons, I could
give them candy cigars and popcorn and ice cream. And right
there I stayed until, as you know, I caught old Jingles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have caught old Jingles the Magician!” cried the
Princess.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” Gran’ma laughed, “and he also caught Janey and
Johnny and the Soft-Voiced Cow and myself!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had forgotten the Princess did not know that I had
caught the wicked creature and that we left him jumping to
beat the band and hanging on to the electric wire,” the Chief
of Detectives said. Then, turning to the Princess, he continued,
“I was careful to turn on the current so that he would
have a good dose too!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am truly glad we have all escaped from him,” the Princess
said and as all had finished eating by this time she asked
Gran’ma, “How would you like to ride about the City of Nite
and see the sights?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, let’s do!” Gran’ma cried, jumping up. “I have
always wanted to go to a City and we never felt we had enough
money to do so when we were upon the Earth!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Well, you will find everything in the City of Nite free
to all of you,” laughed the Princess, “for everyone knows all
about you and what you have done for us, so if you are all of
the same mind we can start right now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s walk!” said Gran’ma, when the Princess said something
about carriages. “Then we can all be together and look
in the shop windows and have lots more fun!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I often walk about the town, or at least, I used to walk
about, before I was put in the Green Jar,” the Princess replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s nice to get up from the table and not have to worry
about doing the dishes,” said Gran’ma. “Let’s start right
away. Gran’pa, you’ll have to buy a bag of peanuts apiece.
We always have peanuts when we go to town,” she explained
to the Princess.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had we better take an umbrella?” asked Gran’pa. “One
usually carries an umbrella when one goes to town. It might
rain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps it would be as well to take the Magic Umbrella
with us,” the Princess laughed, although she could not understand
just why Gran’pa should wish to carry one, for it very
seldom rained in the beautiful City.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_158.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>So the happy visitors walked down the great steps of the
Castle with the Princess and her old friends and into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>shopping center of the City of Nite, where all the kindly faced
people bowed to them all as they passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess stopped and talked with the people and gave
presents to the little children whom they met.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the first store they came to Gran’pa tried to buy some
peanuts, but the shopkeeper would not accept anything for
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You couldn’t pay anyhow,” Johnny laughed. “You
haven’t any Moon money, it’s all Earth money in your purse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure it is,” Gran’pa replied. “I had forgotten
that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess took them into all the ice cream parlors and
candy stores in the City, and when they returned to the Castle
all were loaded with bundles.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they neared the steps of the Castle, Gran’pa shouted,
“Look at the crowd near the Castle door. It must be people
who have come to see you about something!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess looked worried. “No,” she replied, “they
would never crowd about the Castle door in such a disorderly
manner. Something has happened!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as they started up the long flight of steps, the crowd
separated and as the people fell back on either side a tall form
dashed out of the doorway waving his crooked stick and shouting
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Old Jingles, the Magician!” the Princess cried as she
sank to the steps.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Gran’ma Tweaks Old Jingles’ Nose</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Gran’ma, Janey and Mrs. Tiptoe rushed to the Princess
and, raising her between them, they half carried
and half dragged her back down the marble steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Chief of Detectives, the Dancing Master, Johnny and
Gran’pa sprang up the steps to meet the Magician. But the
Chief of Detectives and Johnny caught their feet together and
went tumbling to the foot of the hard stone steps, where they
lay dazed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dancing Master, who was very active, sprang up the
steps two at a time and met the Magician on the broad landing
and attacked him, although he scarcely reached to the
Magician’s waist.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Old Jingles struck at the Dancing Master with his cane, but
the Dancing Master dodged in under the blow and grappled
with the Magician.</p>

<p class='c010'>The good people of Nite were terror stricken, and stood
motionless as the two struggled together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally the Magician pulled his tiny bellows from his
pocket and blew it toward the Dancing Master’s back, and the
Dancing Master fell to the steps, just as Gran’pa struck the
bellows from the Magician’s hand with his cane.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a roar of pain and rage the wicked Jingles swung his
crooked stick at Gran’pa’s head. Gran’pa warded off the blow
with his own polished cane and, using it as a sword, he jabbed
old Jingles in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Magician swung his large crooked stick again, and
Gran’pa again poked him in the stomach, and then, as the
wicked creature backed away, Gran’pa gave him a smart tap
on the head, sending his tall hat spinning down the steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess had recovered and was watching the duel with
fascination. Gran’ma was struggling between Janey and Mrs.
Tiptoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me go!” she cried. “Let me get to him! I’ll tweak his
nose! He shan’t hurt Gran’pa! Let me go!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Janey and Mrs. Tiptoe held her and tried to watch
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t the people help?” Gran’ma cried. “Let me
go, I tell you! I’ll show him, the wicked old thing!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Gran’pa had just swung his cane at the Magician’s head
again hoping to finish him with one more blow, but the
Magician stepped to one side and struck Gran’pa on the head,
sending him to his knees. Gran’pa, however much the blow
hurt, never uttered a groan, and as he struggled dizzily to his
feet he tried to ward off the blows that old Jingles showered
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Part of the blows Gran’pa received on his left arm, the
others slid harmlessly off his cane.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa backed away from the Magician and his face was
worried, for the blow upon his head had made Gran’pa weak in
the knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>But although he dodged and gave ground Gran’pa waited
for an opening and at last, as the Magician missed a swing at
Gran’pa’s head, Gran’pa drew his cane back over his shoulder
and brought it down with all his might upon old Jingles’ crown.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blow was of such force it would have broken the
Magician’s head if the cane had not split in two, and as it was
the wicked man staggered from the blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa, with but the handle of his cane in his hand,
jumped forward to strike again, but he missed his footing and
went rolling down the stone steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Gran’pa fell in front of the Magician, the Princess,
Janey and Mrs. Tiptoe started running.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Run for your lives!” cried the Princess. “He will change
all of us into animals! Run!”</p>

<div id='Catching'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_163.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>Catching his long nose in her hands she gave it a tweak. (page <a href='#Page_145'>145</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The Magician staggered after Gran’pa who had rolled
clear to the bottom of the long flight of steps. The Magician
in his anger did not see Johnny or the Chief of Detectives, who
still sat in a daze part of the way down the steps, so as he
passed them, Johnny stuck his foot out and tripped up the
Magician.</p>

<p class='c010'>Down the long flight of steps the Magician fell, his long
arms and legs hitting the steps and his crooked stick flying high
in the air as he turned over and over.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnny, though still dazed, got to his feet and started down
the steps, hoping he could get the Magician’s crooked stick.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Magician rolled to the bottom of the steps and he
found Gran’ma there to meet him; for as soon as the others
had started to run, they had released Gran’ma.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Gran’ma waited until old Jingles had stopped rolling,
then she rushed at him, and, catching his long nose in her hands,
she gave it a tweak.</p>

<p class='c010'>With one scream of pain, the Magician lay still, and as
Johnny raised the crooked stick to bring it down upon Jingles’
head, Gran’ma stopped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I said I’d tweak his nose,” Gran’ma cried, “and I’ll tweak
it again just as soon as he awakens!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa sat up and looked around.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give me another sack of peanuts,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Magician showed signs of awakening, so Gran’ma gave
his long nose another tweak which made him lie still.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>The Princess called to the people still standing around the
door of the Castle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Call the Guards!” she shouted. “We’ll tie him and keep
him chained up for ever!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The voice of their Princess seemed to arouse the people from
their numbness and fear and eight Guards came running out
from behind the great doors where they had hidden themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Guards came to pick up the Magician to carry
him away Gran’ma pushed them back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No you don’t!” she told them. “He stays right here
while I tweak his nose until he never has another speck of magic
in him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And as the Magician stirred again, Gran’ma gave his long
nose another hard tweek.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But Gran’ma,” Janey cried, “the Princess must be obeyed!
She wants the wicked creature put in chains and in prison!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, you let me be!” Gran’ma said. “I’m boss here and
here he stays until I—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as this moment the Dancing Master rushed down the
steps and blew a puff from the magic bellows upon the face of
old Jingles. It first formed a puffy white cloud, then it settled
grain by grain. There was a breathless silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma did not finish what she was about to say, for as
the magic powder touched the Magician’s face, his long nose
disappeared, his wicked eyes changed and his face took on the
appearance of a young man. And as they all watched in wonder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and amazement they saw his long, thin fingers change into
young hands, and the thin form beneath the torn, dusty clothes
alter until a fine young man lay before them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dancing Master blew another puff of the powder upon
the prostrate form and the old torn clothes changed into silk
and velvet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me!” Gran’ma cried. “Perhaps we have made a
mistake! It isn’t old Jingles!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And when the Strange Young Man opened his eyes and
saw the crowd standing around him, he ran his hand across
his forehead as if trying to recollect something.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where am I?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are in the City of Nite,” answered the Princess.
“Guards, assist him into the Castle!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I can walk,” said the Strange Young Man, “but
I cannot imagine how I got here, for I have never heard of the
City of Nite before.” And with this he stood upon his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is indeed strange,” said the Princess. “Let us all
go into the Castle.” And as the people drew aside to let them
pass, the Princess, Mrs. Tiptoe, Gran’ma and Janey went up
the steps, followed by the Strange Young Man, the Tiptoe
Brothers, Gran’pa and Johnny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My name is David,” the Strange Young Man said, when
all had taken chairs in the Princess’ drawing room and he saw
that they looked to him for an explanation, “and my home is
in Dayland, or at least,” he continued, “it used to be there.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Dayland is on the other side of the Moon!” said the
Princess. “My father and mother and I visited there once!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If Dayland is on the other side of the Moon,” said David,
“this must be the Land Back of the Moon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is,” the Princess replied. “If you looked through the
Moon you would see it. It’s the Magical Land of Noom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How strange that I should be here!” and David passed
his hand over his forehead in a puzzled manner. “I faintly
remember strange rhymes and jingles of which I dreamed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did not dream them,” Gran’ma hastened to explain.
“You were old Jingles the Magician until a few moments
ago, then Mr. Tiptoe puffed the magic powder on you and
changed you back to your own self.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me,” sighed David. “If this is true tell me how
long I have been in this strange shape, for I speak truly when I
tell you that I am really at a loss to account for the cruel and
wicked things which I must have done while I was not myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You first came to the City of Nite as a witch and said you
were the Princess,” the Chief of Detectives told him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you will remember,” the Princess said, turning to the
Chief of Detectives, “that I met him first as Old Jingles, when
I saw the Queer Horse who had eaten his head off, and that was
over eighty years ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me,” David sighed. “Then there is no telling how
long I have been old Jingles or the Witch. I’m awfully sorry,”
he told the Princess. “I wouldn’t have harmed you for the
world.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“Isn’t it just like a fairy tale!” Janey cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps it is,” David smiled, “but it seems
like a disagreeable dream to me and until I get
back to my own country, I really cannot explain
how it all came about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the last thing you remember?”
Johnny asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me see! We were having a great ball
or something at the Castle and I had just stepped
outside the door to look at the Sun when—when—well,
that is the last thing I can recall, except
the queer dreams about rhymes and jingles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t remember what you did with
our Flying Boat, do you?” Johnny asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I can not recall a Flying
Boat, at all,” David answered.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_169.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“That was the only way we had of returning to the Earth,”
Gran’ma said, a little sadly, “and I feel that we should return
as soon as we can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Gran’pa had told him of the children’s Flying Boat
and how he had made one to follow the children to the Moon,
David said, “Perhaps you could make another and so return
to the Earth! Perhaps you could take me to my home in it,
first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’pa asked the Princess if he could build another Flying
Boat and although the Princess wished them to stay at the
Castle with her always, she realized that they must be as
anxious to return to the Earth as she had been to return to the
City of Nite. So the Princess sent word to the Royal Carpenter
to bring boards and nails to the Castle roof and there
Gran’pa superintended the building of the new Flying Boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>While this was being built, the Princess took her friends to
visit her father and mother, with whom they spent two happy
weeks, seeing the sights and having dances and dinners given
in their honor.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they returned to the City of Nite, the Flying Boat
had been completed and stood upon the Castle roof all ready to
sail. It was a sturdy, beautifully built machine—quite the
nicest one that has ever been made.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were tears in the eyes of the Princess and Mrs. Tiptoe
as David, Gran’ma, Gran’pa and the children took their seats
in the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Good-bye! Good-bye!” they cried. “Do not forget
that we shall be most happy to have you visit us again!” And
the Princess gave Gran’ma, Gran’pa, Janey and Johnny each

<p class='c010'>Then when she had kissed them all good-bye again Gran’pa
turned the little knob marked “Start” and the new Flying
Boat rose slowly from the roof of the Castle and sailed away.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Princess and the people of Nite watched the Flying
Boat until it was out of sight, and then the Princess and Mrs.
Tiptoe and the Tiptoe Brothers went into the Castle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wished for them to stay,” said the Princess. “Didn’t
you love them all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed I did,” Mrs. Tiptoe answered as she wiped her
eyes. “They were all so kind and unselfish.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“It is nice to know and love them,” said Mr. Tiptoe, “and
while I know they had many unpleasant experiences in the
Magical Land of Noom, I am so glad they came.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied the Princess, “we owe all our present happiness
to them and I hope they will come again to visit us soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s all write a long letter and send it to them,” the
Chief of Detectives suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?” the others inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us write the letter, then address it care of the Earth
and puff the magic powder upon it. They will be sure to
receive it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is an excellent idea!” the Princess cried joyfully.
“We will start it right away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So they all set to work on the letter, so as to send it off at
once.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>When the Flying Boat was out of sight of the City
of Nite, Gran’pa pressed the speed button and the
new craft shot through the air like a comet, passing
over the mountains and valleys in a flash. In a very few
moments it had covered a distance that had taken the travelers
long hours to walk.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new Flying Boat whizzed around the bend in the Moon
and flew over the side which is always turned towards the
Earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This must be the Dayland in which you live!” Gran’pa
said to David.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“It is!” David answered. “See, there is the Earth!”</p>

<p class='c010'>By shading their eyes from the Sun, Gran’ma, Gran’pa
and the children could see a blue-green Star winking and blinking
in the sky and could faintly make out the shape of the land
and the oceans upon its surface.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they sped along above the Moon, they watched the wonderful
changes in coloring below them. They saw many cities
and villages and looked into enormous craters of extinct volcanoes.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last they saw in the distance a city of white with wonderful
steeples and towers on the great building standing in
the center. It was a regular fairy book castle with glistening
windows and hanging gardens.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There it is!” David shouted. “Guide the Flying Boat
to the balcony at the right of the Palace!” And as Gran’pa
brought the Flying Boat to rest as directed, many people rushed
out of the Palace, and knelt before David. “Our King has
returned!” they shouted. “Long live the King!” And they
all came and kissed his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>When David saw Gran’ma and Gran’pa and Janey and
Johnny looking at him in astonishment he put his arms around
them and helped them from the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We did not know you were a King!” exclaimed Janey.</p>

<p class='c010'>The King laughed for the first time and it was such a
cheery, pleasant laugh they almost forgot that he was a King
and Gran’ma gave his hand a squeeze.</p>

<div id='There'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_175.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic005'>
<p>“There it is!” David shouted. “Guide the Flying Boat to the balcony at the right of the Palace!” (page <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>As the King led them inside the Palace all the bells in the
city began chiming. “You must at least stay and have dinner
with me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The King wished them to stay until he had learned how
he came to change characters, but as soon as they had finished
dinner, Gran’ma said they must leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I can discover just what happened when I walked out
to look at the Sun,” the King laughed as he said good-bye, “I
will write to you and try to find a way to get the letter into
your hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems as if you could make a little Flying Boat and
put the letter in it and send it to us,” Johnny said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you can expect to hear from me,” the King replied,
as he waved good-bye to them.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_177.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma and the children took a nap while Gran’pa guided
the Flying Boat on its return trip
and when he finally awakened
them, the new Flying Boat stood
in the back yard near the kitchen
door at Gran’pa’s home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” said Gran’ma as she
jumped out of the boat, “the Castle
of the Princess was comfortable
and beautiful and King David’s
Palace was magnificent, but our
little old home is the best of all!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home!”
Gran’pa sang as he helped Janey from the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope the moths haven’t got in the carpets!” Gran’ma
said, as she opened the back door.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_178.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Johnny ran to the chicken shed and came back with six or
seven eggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janey helped Gran’ma set the table and Gran’pa built the
kitchen fire. Then Gran’pa went to the smoke-house and
brought in a large ham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll have some good old ham and eggs!” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gran’ma made the fluffiest biscuits she had ever baked and
they sat down to a breakfast which they all enjoyed more than
they had ever enjoyed a breakfast before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now that we are back home again, doesn’t it all seem far
away and strange, like a fairy tale one has read a long time
ago?” Gran’ma suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and like a real fairy tale, it has turned out very
happily,” Gran’pa smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if we shall ever hear from the Princess or from
the King,” Johnny said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the King should marry the
beautiful Princess, just as all pretty fairy tales end?” mused
Gran’ma.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
